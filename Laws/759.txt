      Note: 759.016 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 759 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      759.020 Certificate of authority; application; procedure; criteria; intrastate toll service level; rules. (1) No person, corporation, company, association of individuals or their lessees, trustees, or receivers shall provide intrastate telecommunications service on a for-hire basis without a certificate of authority issued by the Public Utility Commission under this section.

      (2) Applications for certificates of authority shall be in a form prescribed by the commission and shall describe the telecommunications services the applicant proposes to provide. Notice of all applications shall, within 30 days of filing, be served by the commission upon all persons holding authority to provide telecommunications service issued under this section or providing local exchange telecommunications service.

      (3) Except as provided in ORS 759.050, no certificate shall authorize any person to provide local exchange telecommunications service within the local exchange telecommunications service area of a telecommunications utility unless such utility consents, is unable to provide the service, or fails to protest an application. This subsection shall not apply to any application for a certificate by a provider of shared telecommunications services.

      (4) After notice, a hearing need not be held prior to issuance of a certificate of authority except upon the commission’s own motion or unless the application is to authorize a person to provide local exchange telecommunications service in the local exchange telecommunications service area of a telecommunications utility and such utility protests. After hearing, the commission shall issue the certificate only upon a showing that the proposed service is required by the public interest.

      (5) The commission may classify a successful applicant for a certificate as a telecommunications utility or as a competitive telecommunications services provider. If the commission finds that a successful applicant for a certificate has demonstrated that services it offers are subject to competition or that its customers or those proposed to become customers have reasonably available alternatives, the commission shall classify the applicant as a competitive telecommunications services provider. The commission shall conduct the initial classification and any subsequent review of the classification in accordance with such procedures as the commission may establish by rule, after hearings. The commission may attach reasonable conditions to such classification and may amend or revoke any such order as provided in ORS 756.568. For purposes of this section, in determining whether telecommunications services are subject to competition or whether there are reasonably available alternatives, the commission shall consider:

      (a) The extent to which services are available from alternative providers in the relevant market.

      (b) The extent to which the services of alternative providers are functionally equivalent or substitutable at comparable rates, terms and conditions.

      (c) Existing economic or regulatory barriers to entry.

      (d) Any other factors deemed relevant by the commission.

      (6) Any provider of intrastate toll service must inform customers of the service level furnished by that provider, according to rules of the commission. The commission, by rule, shall determine the level of intrastate toll service that is standard. Any provider of intrastate toll service must identify the service level the provider plans to furnish in an annual report to the commission. The commission shall revoke the certification of any provider that does not consistently furnish the service level identified in the provider’s annual report. [Formerly 757.815; 1991 c.326 §1; 1993 c.423 §1]

 

      759.025 Certificates of authority for persons, companies and corporations providing services on January 1, 1986. (1) Notwithstanding ORS 759.020, the Public Utility Commission shall issue to any person, company or corporation providing intrastate telecommunications services that are subject to regulation by the commission on January 1, 1986, a certificate of authority to continue to provide those services on and after January 1, 1986.

      (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the commission shall issue to any cooperative corporation, or unincorporated association providing intrastate telecommunications service on January 1, 1986, a certificate of authority to continue to provide those services on and after January 1, 1986. Such actions shall not subject such cooperative corporations or association to the commission’s general powers of regulation. [Formerly 757.820]

 

      759.027 Shared telecommunications service provider; alternative access to local exchange telecommunications services. If the Public Utility Commission finds upon notice and investigation that customers of shared telecommunications services have no alternative access to local exchange telecommunications services, the commission may require the shared telecommunications service provider to make alternative facilities or conduit space available on reasonable terms and conditions and at reasonable prices. [2005 c.232 §5]

 

      759.030 [Formerly 757.825; 1991 c.301 §1; repealed by 2005 c.232 §6]

 

      759.035 Duty to furnish adequate and safe service at reasonable rates. Every telecommunications utility is required to furnish adequate and safe service, equipment and facilities, and the charges made by any public utility for any service rendered or to be rendered in connection therewith shall be reasonable and just, and every unjust or unreasonable charge for such service is prohibited. [1987 c.447 §3]

      (4) Upon petition by any telecommunications utility serving fewer than 50,000 access lines in Oregon and affiliated or under common control with another public utility providing service in Oregon, and a finding that such action is consistent with the public interest, the commission by order may exempt such telecommunications utility from:

      (a) ORS 759.180 to 759.190.

      (b) ORS 759.375 to 759.393.

      (c) ORS 759.300 to 759.360.

      (6) Upon petition by the telecommunications utility or upon petition by 10 percent of the then current access line subscribers, or 500 subscribers, whichever is the lesser, of any telecommunications utility:

      (a) Filed with the commission not less than 10 days prior to the proposed effective date of new or revised tariff schedules, the commission may impose all or part of the procedures of ORS 759.180 to 759.190 to any of the schedules of a telecommunications utility exempted from ORS 759.180 to 759.190 pursuant to this section.

      (b) After notice and hearing and a finding that the action is required by the public interest, the commission may revoke any exemption granted pursuant to this section or impose reasonable conditions upon the continued exercise of the exemption.

      (7) Any telecommunications utility for which an exemption from the application of ORS 759.180 to 759.190 is provided pursuant to this section shall notify its affected customers of any price increase for intrastate telecommunications services at least 45 days prior to the proposed effective date of the increase.

      (8) Any telecommunications utility for which an exemption from the application of any statute is provided pursuant to this section shall file with the commission an annual report that includes copies of the income statement and balance sheet the telecommunications utility files with the Federal Communications Commission. Each telecommunications utility described in this subsection shall notify customers that the income statement and balance sheet are on file with the commission. [Formerly 757.870; 1999 c.451 §1; 2005 c.232 §12]

 

      759.045 Special rules for utilities exempted from regulation under ORS 759.040. The Public Utility Commission shall adopt specific rules to apply to telecommunications utilities which are exempted from certain regulation under ORS 759.040. An objective of these rules shall be to minimize the regulatory burden on these utilities to the extent this objective is feasible and consistent with the public interest. These rules shall not pertain to the statutes from which these utilities are exempted under ORS 759.040. [1991 c.658 §2]

 

      759.050 Competitive zone service regulation. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “Competitive zone” means a telecommunications service area within all or part of a local exchange, described both by service and territory, that has been designated a competitive zone by the Public Utility Commission under subsection (2) or (4) of this section.

      (b) “Competitive zone service” means a local exchange telecommunications service that the commission has authorized to be provided within a competitive zone.

      (c) “Essential function” means a functional component of a competitive zone service necessary to the provision of the service by a telecommunications provider for which there is no adequate alternative in terms of quality, quantity and price to the incumbent telecommunications utility.

      (d) “Telecommunications utility” and “competitive provider” mean those entities that are classified as such by the commission under ORS 759.020. “Telecommunications provider” includes both telecommunications utilities and competitive providers.

      (2)(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS 759.020 (3), the commission may certify one or more persons, including another telecommunications utility, to provide local exchange telecommunications service within the local exchange telecommunications service area of a certificated telecommunications utility if the commission determines that the authorization would be in the public interest. For the purpose of determining whether the authorization would be in the public interest, the commission shall consider:

      (A) The effect on rates for local exchange telecommunications service customers both within and outside the competitive zone.

      (B) The effect on competition in the local exchange telecommunications service area.

      (C) The effect on access by customers to high quality, innovative telecommunications service in the local exchange telecommunications service area.

      (D) Any other facts the commission considers relevant.

      (b) Upon certification of a telecommunications provider under paragraph (a) of this subsection, the commission shall establish a competitive zone defined by the services to be provided by the telecommunications provider and the geographic area to be served by the telecommunications provider. Price and service competition within the meaning of ORS 759.052 may not be deemed to exist by virtue of the establishment of a competitive zone.

      (c) At the time of certification of a telecommunications provider, or thereafter, the commission may impose reasonable conditions upon the authority of the telecommunications provider to provide competitive zone service within the competitive zone. Reasonable conditions include, but are not limited to, conditions:

      (A) Designed to promote fair competition, such as interconnection; and

      (B) Requiring contributions of the type required of a telecommunications utility on account of the provision of local exchange service, including those to the Residential Service Protection Fund or the Telecommunication Devices Access Program.

      (3) Upon demand, a competitive provider of competitive zone services shall make available to the commission any information relating to competitive zone services that the commission requests. Information provided to the commission by a competitive provider under this subsection shall be confidential and may not be disclosed by the commission, except for regulatory purposes in the context of a proceeding before the commission.

      (4) Upon application by a telecommunications utility and a showing of competition within its local exchange, whether or not from certificated providers, the commission may designate all or part of the local exchange a competitive zone.

      (5)(a) Except with respect to telecommunications utilities that are exempt from the provisions of ORS 759.180 to 759.190, unless the commission determines that it is not in the public interest at the time a competitive zone is created, upon designation of a competitive zone, price changes, service variations and modifications of competitive zone services offered by a telecommunications utility in the zone are not subject to ORS 759.180 to 759.190 and, at the telecommunication utility’s discretion, may be made effective upon filing with the commission.

      (b) The price and terms of service offered by a telecommunications utility for a competitive zone service within a competitive zone may differ from that outside of the zone. However, the price for a competitive zone service within the zone may not be lower than the total service long run incremental cost, for nonessential functions, of providing the service within the zone and the charges for essential functions used in providing the service, but the commission may establish rates for residential local exchange telecommunications service at any level necessary to achieve the commission’s universal service objectives. Within the zone, the price of a competitive zone service, or any essential function used in providing the competitive zone service, may not be higher than those prices in effect when the competitive zone was established, unless authorized by the commission.

      (c) The commission may revoke the exemption of a telecommunications utility from ORS 759.180 to 759.190 if the commission finds that the utility has violated statutes, rules or conditions of the commission applicable to competitive zone services or that there has been a substantial change in the circumstances that prevailed at the time the competitive zone was first established.

      (d) On the motion of a telecommunications provider or on its own motion, the commission may order a telecommunications utility to disaggregate and offer essential functions of the telecommunications utility’s local exchange network.

      (6) A decision of the commission, with respect to the terms and conditions under which competitive zone services may be offered within a competitive zone by a telecommunications utility, to authorize a competitor to provide service within the local exchange service area of a telecommunications utility or to otherwise designate a competitive zone shall be subject to judicial review, but may not be stayed other than by order of the commission, except upon a showing by clear and convincing evidence that failure to stay the decision will result in irreparable harm to the aggrieved party.

      (7) The exclusive remedy of a telecommunications provider aggrieved by the prices, terms of service or practices of another provider with respect to competitive zone services within a competitive zone is to file a complaint with the commission under ORS 756.500. The commission, either upon complaint or its own motion, may permanently suspend a filing made by a provider with respect to a competitive zone service or take such other action as the commission deems appropriate, except an award for damages. A claim for damages arising from a commission decision in favor of the provider on a matter alleged in the complaint shall be brought as a separate action at law.

      (8) Nothing in this section shall serve to shield any telecommunications provider of local exchange telecommunications service from state or federal antitrust laws.

      (9) The commission shall report annually to the Legislative Assembly:

      (a) The number of competitive zones created under ORS 759.020 and 759.050;

      (b) The number of competitive providers authorized under ORS 759.020 and 759.050;

      (c) The number and types of competitive services made available to consumers; and

      (d) Consumer comments on competitive telecommunications services. [1993 c.423 §3; 2005 c.232 §13]

 

      759.052 Commission authority to exempt telecommunications services from regulation. (1)(a) Upon petition by any interested party and following notice and investigation, the Public Utility Commission may exempt in whole or in part from regulation those telecommunications services for which the commission finds that:

      (A) Price or service competition exists;

      (B) Telecommunications services can be demonstrated by the petitioner or the commission to be subject to competition; or

      (C) The public interest no longer requires full regulation of the telecommunications services.

      (b) The commission may attach reasonable conditions to an exemption made under paragraph (a) of this subsection and may amend or revoke any order as provided in ORS 756.568.

      (2) Upon petition by a telecommunications utility, and after notice and hearing, the commission shall exempt a telecommunications service from regulation if the commission finds that price and service competition exists.

      (3) Prior to making the findings required by subsection (1) or (2) of this section, the commission shall consider:

      (a) The extent to which services are available from alternative providers in the relevant market.

      (b) The extent to which the services of alternative providers are functionally equivalent or substitutable at comparable rates and under comparable terms and conditions.

      (c) Existing economic or regulatory barriers to entry.

      (d) Any other factors deemed relevant by the commission.

      (4) A service that is deregulated under subsection (2) of this section may be reregulated, after notice and hearing, if the commission determines an essential finding on which the deregulation was based no longer prevails, and reregulation is necessary to protect the public interest. [2005 c.232 §8]

 

      759.054 Price listing for product or service offered as part of local exchange telecommunications services. (1) If the Public Utility Commission determines that a product or service offered by a telecommunications utility as part of local exchange telecommunications services can be demonstrated by the utility to be subject to competition, or that a product or service is not an essential product or service, the commission may authorize the utility to file a price list with the commission.

      (2) The price list shall contain the description, terms, conditions and prices of the service or product described in subsection (1) of this section. No other schedule for price listed services need be filed with the commission. The price list or any revision of the price list is not subject to the provisions of ORS 759.180 to 759.190 and shall become effective immediately upon filing with the commission unless a later date is specified.

      (3) In determining whether a product or service is subject to competition, the commission shall consider:

      (a) The extent to which services are available from alternative providers in the relevant market.

      (b) The extent to which services of alternative providers are functionally equivalent or substitutable at comparable rates or under comparable terms and conditions.

      (c) Existing economic or regulatory barriers to entry.

      (d) Any other factors deemed relevant by the commission. [2005 c.232 §9]

 

      759.056 Price listing for product or service offered as part of interexchange telecommunications services. (1) If the Public Utility Commission determines that a product or service offered by a telecommunications utility as part of interexchange telecommunications services can be demonstrated by the utility to be subject to competition, the commission, under conditions that the commission determines are reasonable, may authorize the utility to file a price list with the commission.

      (2) The price list shall contain the description, terms, conditions and prices of the service or product described in subsection (1) of this section. No other schedule for price listed services need be filed with the commission. The price list or any revision of the price list is not subject to the provisions of ORS 759.180 to 759.190 and shall become effective immediately on filing with the commission unless a later date is specified.

      (3) In determining whether a product or service is subject to competition, the commission shall consider:

      (a) The extent to which services are available from alternative providers in the relevant market.

      (b) The extent to which services of alternative providers are functionally equivalent or substitutable at comparable rates or under comparable terms and conditions.

      (c) Existing economic or regulatory barriers to entry.

      (d) Any other factors deemed relevant by the commission. [2005 c.232 §10]

 

      759.058 Commission action on petition under ORS 759.052, 759.054 or 759.056. Within 60 days of a filing under ORS 759.052, 759.054 or 759.056, the Public Utility Commission shall either determine the appropriateness of the filing or determine that further investigation is necessary. If the commission determines that further investigation is necessary, the commission may suspend operation of the filing for a period not longer than five months from the end of the initial 60-day period. Upon a showing of good cause, any party may request extension of the suspension period for an additional three months. [2005 c.232 §11]

 

      759.060 Information submitted by local exchange telecommunications utilities; rules exempting disclosure. (1) The Public Utility Commission, by rule, shall specify information submitted to the commission by local exchange telecommunications utilities or cooperatives that is exempt from disclosure under ORS 192.311 to 192.478 as provided in this section. In adopting rules, the commission shall consider, among other matters:

      (a) Whether the information is of a type that could potentially be used to the competitive disadvantage of a local exchange telecommunications utility or cooperative.

      (b) Whether the information concerns matters of a nature personal to an employee or stockholder of a local exchange telecommunications utility or an employee or member of a cooperative.

      (c) Whether the information is otherwise publicly available.

      (2) Information specified under subsection (1) of this section is exempt from disclosure unless the public interest requires disclosure in the particular instance.

      (3) Nothing in subsection (1) of this section limits the exemptions granted to a local exchange telecommunications utility or cooperative under ORS 192.311 to 192.478. [1995 c.538 §2]

 

      759.070 Charge to access public body radio tower; market rate; exception. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “Market rate” means a price, lease rate or other form of compensation for goods or services provided by a public body, when participating in a proprietary transaction, that is comparable to the average price, lease rate or other form of compensation in the same market for the same goods or services provided by a private-sector provider.

      (b) “Private business” does not include a nonprofit emergency services organization.

      (c) “Public body” has the meaning given that term in ORS 174.109.

      (d) “Radio tower” means a lattice tower that is generally 60 to 200 feet tall with three or four steel support legs, or a monopole that is generally 25 to 125 feet tall, to which multiple antennae may be attached to accommodate a variety of communication services, including radio communications service, radio paging and cellular communications service.

      (2) A public body shall charge a private business a market rate for access to a radio tower if the private business uses the radio tower to deliver any of the following communication services for hire:

      (a) Radio communications service;

      (b) Radio paging; or

      (c) Cellular communications service.

      (3) Subsection (2) of this section does not prohibit a public body, when participating in a proprietary transaction, from charging or receiving compensation in the form of an exchange of goods or services or in any other nonmonetary form. [2013 c.440 §1]

 

      Note: 759.070 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 759 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

RIGHTS OF WAY

 

      759.075 Authority to construct lines and facilities; condemnation power; procedure. (1) Any telecommunications utility may:

      (a) Enter upon lands within this state for the purpose of examining, locating and surveying the line thereof and also other lands necessary and convenient for the purpose of construction of service facilities, doing no unnecessary damage thereby.

      (b) Condemn such lands not exceeding 100 feet in width for its lines (including poles, towers, wires, supports and necessary equipment therefor) and in addition thereto, other lands necessary and convenient for the purpose of construction of service facilities.

      (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, any telecommunications utility may, when necessary or convenient for transmission lines (including poles, towers, wires, supports and necessary equipment therefor) designed for voltages in excess of 330,000 volts, condemn land not to exceed 300 feet in width. In addition, if the lands are covered by trees which are liable to fall and constitute a hazard to its wire or line, such telecommunications utility may condemn such trees for a width not exceeding 100 feet on either side of the condemned land, as may be necessary or convenient for such purpose.

      (3) The proceedings for the condemnation of such lands shall be the same as that provided in ORS chapter 35, provided that any award shall include, but shall not be limited to, damages for destruction of forest growth, premature cutting of timber and diminution in value to remaining timber caused by increased harvesting costs. [1987 c.447 §69]

If such parties are unable to agree, the telecommunications utility may condemn so much thereof as is necessary and convenient in the location and construction of the poles or lines. The provisions of ORS chapter 35 are applicable to condemnations under this section. [1987 c.447 §70]

 

      759.100 [1987 c.447 §5; repealed by 2005 c.232 §14]

ACCOUNTS AND RECORDS

 

      759.120 Form and manner of accounts prescribed by commission. (1) Every telecommunications utility shall keep and render to the Public Utility Commission, in the manner and form prescribed by the commission, uniform accounts of all business transacted. All forms of accounts which may be prescribed by the commission shall conform as nearly as practicable to similar forms prescribed by federal authority.

      (2) Every telecommunications utility engaged directly or indirectly in any other business than that of a telecommunications utility shall, if required by the commission, keep and render separately to the commission, in like manner and form, the accounts of all such other business, in which case all the provisions of this chapter shall apply with like force and effect to the accounts and records of such other business. [1987 c.447 §8]

 

      759.125 Records and accounts prescribed by commission; prohibition on other records or accounts; exception; blanks for reports. (1) The Public Utility Commission shall prescribe the accounts and records required to be kept and every telecommunications utility is required to keep and render its accounts and records accurately and faithfully in the manner prescribed by the commission and to comply with all directions of the commission relating to such accounts and records.

      (2) No telecommunications utility shall keep any other accounts or records of its telecommunications utility business transacted than those prescribed or approved by the commission except such as may be required by the laws of the United States.

      (3) The commission shall cause to be prepared suitable blanks for reports for carrying out the purposes of this chapter, and shall, when necessary, furnish such blanks for reports to each telecommunications utility. [1987 c.447 §9]

 

      759.130 Closing date of accounts; filing balance sheet; audit. (1) The accounts shall be closed annually on December 31 and a balance sheet of that date promptly taken therefrom. On or before April 1 following, such balance sheet, together with such other information as the Public Utility Commission shall prescribe, verified by an officer of the telecommunications utility, shall be filed with the commission.

      (2) The commission may examine and audit any account. Items shall be allocated to the accounts in the manner prescribed by the commission. [1987 c.447 §10]

 

      759.135 Depreciation accounts; undepreciated investment allowed in rates; conditions. (1) Every telecommunications utility shall carry a proper and adequate depreciation account. The Public Utility Commission shall ascertain and determine the proper and adequate rates of depreciation of the several classes of property of each telecommunications utility. The rates shall be such as will provide the amounts required over and above the expenses of maintenance, to keep such property in a state of efficiency corresponding to the progress of the industry. Each telecommunications utility shall conform its depreciation accounts to the rates so ascertained and determined by the commission. The commission may make changes in such rates of depreciation from time to time as the commission may find to be necessary.

      (2) In the following cases the commission may allow in rates, directly or indirectly, amounts on the utility’s books of account which the commission finds represent undepreciated investment in a utility plant, including that which has been retired from service:

      (a) When the retirement is due to ordinary wear and tear, casualties, acts of God, acts of governmental authority; or

      (b) When the commission finds that the retirement is in the public interest. [1987 c.447 §11; 1989 c.956 §3]

 

RATE REGULATION AND PROCEDURES; MEASURING EQUIPMENT

 

      759.175 Filing rate schedules and data with commission. (1) Every telecommunications utility shall file with the Public Utility Commission, within a time to be fixed by the commission, schedules showing all rates, tolls and charges that the utility has established and that are in force at the time for any service performed by the utility within the state, or for any service in connection with or performed by any utility controlled or operated by the utility. Schedules filed with the commission shall be open to public inspection.

      (2) Every telecommunications utility shall file, with and as part of every schedule filed under subsection (1) of this section, all rules and regulations that in any manner affect the rates charged or to be charged for any service.

      (3) Where a schedule of joint rates or charges is or may be in force between two or more telecommunications utilities, the schedule shall in like manner be printed and filed with the commission. [1987 c.447 §12; 2005 c.232 §15]

 

      759.180 Hearing on reasonableness of rates; procedures; exceptions. (1)(a) Except as provided in ORS 759.195 and 759.410 and ORS 759.052, 759.054 or 759.056, whenever any telecommunications utility files with the Public Utility Commission any rate or schedule of rates stating or establishing a new rate or schedule of rates or increasing an existing rate or schedule of rates, the commission may, either upon written complaint or upon the commission’s own initiative, after reasonable notice, conduct a hearing to determine the propriety and reasonableness of the rate or schedule. The commission shall conduct the hearing upon written complaint filed by the telecommunications utility, its customer or customers, or any other proper party within 60 days of the telecommunications utility’s filing. A hearing need not be held if the particular rate change is the result of an automatic adjustment clause. At the hearing the telecommunications utility shall bear the burden of showing that the rate or schedule of rates proposed to be established or increased or changed is just and reasonable.

      (b) As used in this subsection, “automatic adjustment clause” means a provision of a rate schedule, authorized pursuant to ORS 759.195 (6), that provides for rate increases, decreases or both, without prior hearing, reflecting increases, decreases or both in costs incurred by a telecommunications utility and that is subject to review by the commission at least once every two years.

      (2) The commission and staff may consult at any time with, and provide technical assistance to, telecommunications utilities, their customers, and other interested parties on matters relevant to utility rates and charges. If a hearing is held with respect to a rate change, the decisions of the commission shall be based on the record made at the hearing. [1987 c.447 §13; 1989 c.5 §16; 2005 c.232 §16]

 

      759.182 Rate schedules for service promotions; rules. (1) A telecommunications utility may file rate schedules for service promotions that are offered by the utility for the purpose of:

      (a) Increasing the use of the utility’s services by present or future customers;

      (b) Preventing a decrease in the use of the utility’s services by present or future customers; or

      (c) Inducing any person to use the utility’s services instead of a competing provider’s services.

      (2) The rates charged under a service promotion by a telecommunications utility must be adequate to ensure that:

      (a) The utility will recover an amount equal to the sum of the total service long run incremental cost of providing the nonessential functions of the service and the price that is charged to other telecommunications carriers for the essential functions; and

      (b) The utility will recover the amount under paragraph (a) of this subsection during the average time that customers use the service.

      (3) Notwithstanding ORS 759.190, service promotion rate schedules become effective upon filing with the Public Utility Commission.

      (4) The commission shall adopt rules governing service promotion rate schedules filed under this section. [2001 c.309 §2]

 

      Note: 759.182 was added to and made a part of 759.180 to 759.190 by legislative action but was not added to any other series. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      759.185 Suspension of rates pending hearing; time limitation; refund of revenue collected; interim rates. (1) The Public Utility Commission may, pending such investigation and determination, order the suspension of the rate or schedule of rates, provided the initial period of suspension shall not extend more than six months beyond the time when such rate or schedule would otherwise go into effect. If the commission finds that the investigation will not be completed at the expiration of the initial suspension, the commission may enter an order further suspending such rate or schedule for not more than three months beyond the last day of the initial suspension.

      (2) This section does not prevent the commission and the telecommunications utility from entering into a written stipulation at any time extending any period of suspension.

      (3) After full hearing, whether completed before or after such rate or schedule has gone into effect, the commission may make such order in reference thereto as would be proper in a proceeding initiated after such rate or schedule has become effective.

      (4) If the commission is required to or determines to conduct a hearing on a rate or schedule of rates filed pursuant to ORS 759.180, but does not order a suspension thereof, any increased revenue collected by the telecommunications utility as a result of such rate or rate schedule becoming effective shall be received subject to being refunded. If the rate or rate schedule thereafter approved by the commission is for a lesser increase or for no increase, the telecommunications utility shall refund the amount of revenues received that exceeds the amount approved as nearly as possible to the customers from whom such excess revenues were collected, by a credit against future bills or otherwise, in such manner as the commission orders.

      (5) The commission may, in a suspension order, authorize an interim rate or rate schedule under which the telecommunications utility’s revenues will be increased by an amount deemed reasonable by the commission, not exceeding the amount requested by the telecommunications utility. An interim rate or rate schedule shall remain in effect until terminated by the commission. [1987 c.447 §14]

 

      759.190 Notice of schedule change. No change shall be made in any schedule, including schedules of joint rates, except upon 30 days’ notice to the Public Utility Commission. All changes shall be plainly indicated upon existing schedules, or by filing new schedules in lieu thereof 30 days prior to the time they are to take effect. However, the commission, for good cause shown, may allow changes without requiring the 30 days’ notice by filing an order specifying the changes to be made and the time when they shall take effect. [1987 c.447 §15]

 

      759.195 Price listing of services; conditions; maximum rates; essential services; justification by utility of rates for price-listed services; rules. (1) Except as provided in subsection (6) of this section, upon petition of a telecommunications utility that provides local exchange service directly, or is affiliated with a utility that provides local exchange service, and after notice and hearing, the Public Utility Commission may authorize the utility to set rates for toll and other telecommunications services by filing a price list containing the price and terms for the service. The price list or any revision of the price list is not subject to the provisions of ORS 759.180 to 759.190 and shall become effective as determined by the commission. The commission may prescribe conditions on an authorization to establish rates by price list, including conditions relating to the sharing of revenues received by the utility that are in excess of allowances provided for in the order of authorization.

      (2) Telecommunications utilities that provide telecommunications services only between exchanges and are not affiliated with a utility that provides local exchange service may establish rates by price list without special authorization from the commission.

      (3) Prior to granting a petition to set rates by price list under this section, the commission shall find that pricing flexibility:

      (a) Is reasonably necessary to enable the utility to respond to current and future competitive conditions for any or all telecommunications services;

      (b) Will maintain the appropriate balance between the need for price flexibility and the protection of consumers;

      (c) Is likely to benefit the consumers of fixed rate services; and

      (d) Is unlikely to cause any undue harm to any customer class.

      (4) A rate set for a service by a utility may not be lower than the long run incremental cost of providing the service.

      (5) Upon its own motion the commission may fix maximum rate levels and terms of service for price listed services and for toll services on noncompetitive routes. Upon request of any affected person, the commission shall fix maximum rate levels and terms of service for price listed services not subject to competition and for toll services on noncompetitive routes.

      (6) By rule, the commission shall designate local exchange services that it deems essential, and rates for such services shall be prescribed under ORS 759.180 to 759.190. The commission also may authorize automatic adjustment clauses which reflect increases, decreases, or both, in particular costs incurred by the utility. For the purposes of this subsection, “essential services” need not be essential for all classes of customers.

      (7) The commission may, at any time, order a telecommunications utility to appear and establish that any of its price listed rates are just and reasonable and in conformity with the requirements of this section and the authorization to price list issued by the commission. Price listed rates shall also be subject to complaint under ORS 756.500. [Formerly 757.850; 2005 c.232 §13a]

 

      759.200 Inclusion of amortizations in rates; deferral of certain expenses or revenues; limitation on amounts; prohibited uses. (1) In addition to powers otherwise vested in the Public Utility Commission, and subject to the limitations contained in subsection (5) of this section, under amortization schedules set by the commission, a rate or rate schedule may reflect the following:

      (a) Amounts lawfully imposed retroactively by order of another governmental agency; or

      (b) Amounts deferred under subsection (2) of this section.

      (2) Upon application of a telecommunications utility or ratepayer or upon the commission’s own motion and after public notice and opportunity for comment, the commission by order may authorize deferral, for later incorporation in rates, telecommunications utility expenses or revenues, the recovery or refund of which the commission finds should be deferred in order to minimize the frequency of rate changes or the fluctuation of rate levels or to match appropriately the costs borne by and benefits received by ratepayers. The authority under this subsection is limited to the following accounts:

      (a) Increases or decreases in amounts incurred by a telecommunications utility resulting from changes in jurisdictional separations approved by the Federal Communications Commission;

      (b) Increases or decreases in amounts incurred by a telecommunications utility resulting from changes in depreciation rates or amortization schedules approved by the commission;

      (c) Increases or decreases in amounts incurred by a telecommunications utility resulting from changes in income, excise, franchise or ad valorem taxes by the federal, state or local governments;

      (d) Increases or decreases in amounts incurred by a telecommunications utility resulting from restoration of telecommunications services interrupted by floods, fires, earthquakes, storms or other acts of nature;

      (e) Increases or decreases in amounts incurred by a telecommunications utility for research, development, planning and advance advertising for products and services not yet in service;

      (f) Increases or decreases in amounts incurred by a telecommunications utility for telephone plant transfers and property sales approved by the commission;

      (g) Increases or decreases in amounts incurred by a telecommunications utility from affiliated interest contracts and transactions approved by the commission;

      (h) Increases or decreases in amounts incurred by a telecommunications utility from attorney’s fees, court settlements and court awards;

      (i) Increases or decreases in amounts incurred by a telecommunications utility resulting from changes in accounting methods approved by the commission; and

      (j) Increases or decreases in amounts incurred by a telecommunications utility from customer service contracts, intercompany service contracts and joint and through service arrangements.

      (3) The commission may authorize deferrals under subsection (2) of this section beginning with the date of application, together with interest established by the commission. A deferral may be authorized for a period not to exceed 12 months beginning on or after the date of application.

      (4) Unless subject to an automatic adjustment clause under ORS 759.180, amounts described in this section shall be allowed in rates only to the extent authorized by the commission in a proceeding to change rates and upon review of the utility’s earnings at the time of application to amortize the deferral.

      (5) In any one year, the overall average rate impact of the amortizations authorized under this section shall not exceed three percent of the telecommunications utility’s gross revenues for the preceding calendar year.

      (6) The provisions of this section may be used as a means of deferring the effect of readily identifiable and readily measurable changes in particular costs or revenues of a telecommunications utility, but shall not be used to implement a claim for an increase or decrease in the overall revenue requirement of a telecommunications utility when the amount of the change or changes would not be known until the completion of a rate case. [1989 c.929 §2]

 

      759.205 Conformance of rates charged with schedule. No telecommunications utility shall charge, demand, collect or receive a greater or less compensation for any service performed by it within the state, or for any service in connection therewith, than is specified in printed rate schedules as may at the time be in force, or demand, collect or receive any rate not specified in such schedule. The rates named therein are the lawful rates until they are changed as provided in this chapter. [1987 c.447 §16]

 

      759.210 Classification of service and rates; considerations; rules. (1) The Public Utility Commission shall provide for a comprehensive classification of service for each telecommunications utility. The classification may take into account the quantity used, the time when used, the purpose for which used, the existence of price competition or a service alternative, the services being provided, the conditions of service and any other reasonable consideration. Based on these considerations the commission may authorize classifications or schedules of rates applicable to individual customers or groups of customers. Each telecommunications utility is required to conform its schedules of rates to such classification. If the commission determines that a tariff filing under ORS 759.175 results in a rate classification primarily related to price competition or a service alternative, the commission, at a minimum, shall consider the following:

      (a) Whether the rate generates revenues at least sufficient to cover relevant short and long run costs of the utility during the term of the rates; and

      (b) Whether the rate generates revenues sufficient to insure that just and reasonable rates are established for remaining customers of the telecommunications utility.

      (2) The commission may prescribe any changes in the form in which the schedules are issued by any telecommunications utility as the commission finds to be expedient. The commission shall adopt rules that allow any person who requests notice of tariff filings described under subsection (1) of this section to receive such notice. [1987 c.447 §17; 1989 c.5 §17; 2005 c.232 §18]

 

      759.215 Public access to schedules. (1) A copy of so much of all schedules, including schedules of joint rates and charges, as the Public Utility Commission deems necessary for the use of the public, shall be made available to the public.

      (2) Except as provided in ORS 759.410 (8), copies of all new schedules shall be made readily accessible to the public as required by the commission 30 days prior to the time the schedules are to take effect, unless the commission prescribes a shorter time. [1987 c.447 §18; 2005 c.232 §19]

 

      759.217 [2001 c.957 §17; repealed by 2011 c.83 §26]

 

      759.218 Revenues and expenses of unregulated activities. (1) A telecommunications utility may not use revenues earned from, or allocate expenses to, that portion of the utility’s business that is regulated under this chapter in order to subsidize activities that are not regulated by this chapter.

      (2) The Public Utility Commission may not require revenues or expenses from an activity that is not regulated under this chapter to be attributed to the regulated activities of a telecommunications utility.

      (3) The commission may approve a telecommunications utility rate proposal for basic local service rates that utilizes revenues from other regulated services to partially cover the costs of providing basic local service. [2005 c.232 §4]

 

      759.219 Certain taxes as operating expense; charge pro rata to users; condition. The privilege tax authorized by ORS 221.515, or other similar exactions imposed by any municipality in this state upon telecommunications utilities for use and occupancy of streets, alleys or highways, or all of them, shall be allowed as an operating expense of the affected telecommunications utilities operating in the municipality for rate-making purposes by the Public Utility Commission. The cost of such privilege tax or other similar exactions shall be charged pro rata to the users of such telecommunications utility within the municipality unless the Public Utility Commission determines on a statewide basis that such pro rata charges would be inequitable, in whole or in part, to city ratepayers or should otherwise be borne as a statewide operating expense by the telecommunications utility. [Formerly 759.105]

 

      759.220 Joint rates and classifications; procedure; considerations. (1) A telecommunications utility may establish reasonable through service and joint rates and classifications with other telecommunications utilities. Telecommunications utilities establishing joint rates shall establish just and reasonable regulations and practices in connection therewith and just, reasonable and equitable divisions thereof, as between the public utilities participating therein which shall not unduly prefer or prejudice any of the participating telecommunications utilities and every unjust and unreasonable rate, classification, regulation, practice and division is prohibited.

      (2) The Public Utility Commission may, and shall, whenever deemed by the commission to be necessary or desirable in the public interest, after full hearing upon complaint, or upon the commission’s own initiative without complaint, establish through service, classifications and joint rates, the divisions of such rates and the terms and conditions under which such through service shall be rendered. If any tariff or schedule canceling any through service or joint rate or classification without the consent of all the telecommunications utilities party thereto, or authorization by the commission is suspended by the commission for investigation, the burden of proof is upon the telecommunications utility proposing such cancellation to show that it is consistent with the public interest.

      (3) Whenever, after full hearing upon complaint or upon the commission’s own initiative without complaint, the commission is of the opinion that the divisions of joint rates between the telecommunications utilities are or will be unjust, unreasonable, inequitable or unduly preferential or prejudicial as between the telecommunications utilities party thereto, whether agreed upon by such telecommunications utilities or otherwise established, the commission shall, by order, prescribe the just, reasonable and equitable divisions thereof to be received by the several telecommunications utilities. In cases where the joint rate was established pursuant to the finding or order of the commission and the divisions thereto are found by the commission to have been unjust, unreasonable or inequitable, or unduly preferential or prejudicial, the commission may also by order determine what, for the period subsequent to the filing of the complaint or petition or the making of the order of investigation, would have been the just, reasonable and equitable division thereof to be received by the several telecommunications utilities and require adjustment to be made in accordance therewith.

      (4) In so prescribing and determining the divisions of joint rates, the commission shall give due consideration, among other things, to:

      (a) The efficiency with which the telecommunications utilities concerned are operated;

      (b) The amount of revenue to pay their respective operating expenses, taxes and a fair return on their telecommunications utility property held for and used in service;

      (c) The importance to the public of the services of such telecommunications utilities;

      (d) Whether any particular participating telecommunications utility is an originating, intermediate or delivering utility; and

      (e) Any other fact or circumstance which ordinarily would entitle one telecommunications utility to a greater or less proportion of the joint rate than another. [1987 c.447 §19]

 

      759.225 Application of ORS 759.220 to unincorporated associations and cooperative corporations. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, ORS 759.220 applies to any unincorporated association or cooperative corporation providing intrastate telecommunications service. The application of ORS 759.220 to unincorporated associations and cooperative corporations:

      (1) Does not allow the Public Utility Commission to establish terms, conditions, classifications or rates for services rendered to members of unincorporated associations or cooperative corporations;

      (2) Does not make unincorporated associations or cooperative corporations subject to the commission’s general powers of regulation;

      (3) Allows the commission to regulate access charges imposed by unincorporated associations and cooperative corporations; and

      (4) Requires unincorporated associations and cooperative corporations to provide information to the commission that the commission deems necessary to establish new extended service areas. [Formerly 757.860; 2001 c.853 §1]

 

      759.230 Measured service rate for business customers; restriction. (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Public Utility Commission shall not authorize a telecommunications utility to implement a rate schedule that includes optional measured service for business customers unless the rate for the service is sufficient to defray all costs that must be incurred to implement the service, including the costs of measuring and billing.

      (2) As used in this section:

      (a) “Local exchange telephone service” means telephone service provided within the boundaries of exchange maps filed with and approved by the commission.

      (b) “Measured service” means local exchange telephone service, the rate for which is based upon the number of calls, length of calls, distance or time of day. [Formerly 757.835]

 

      759.235 Mandatory measured service rate; prohibition. (1) The Public Utility Commission shall be prohibited from requiring any call aggregator, telephone customer or class of customers to pay for local exchange telephone service, or any portion thereof, on a mandatory measured service basis.

      (2) As used in this section:

      (a) “Call aggregator” has the meaning given that term in ORS 759.680.

      (b) “Measured service” means charging for local exchange telephone service based upon number of calls, length of calls, distance, time of day, or any combination thereof.

      (3) Nothing in this section is intended to prohibit the commission from requiring telephone customers to pay on a mandatory measured service basis for:

      (a) Land, marine, or air mobile service.

      (b) Local exchange telephone service resold at a profit.

      (4) The commission shall not change boundaries of local exchange service areas nor take any other actions if such changes or actions have the effect of circumventing subsections (1) and (2) of this section. [Formerly 757.840; 1997 c.317 §1]

 

      759.240 Measuring quality of service; standards; rules. (1) The Public Utility Commission shall ascertain and prescribe for each kind of telecommunications utility suitable and convenient standard commercial units of service. These shall be lawful units for the purposes of this chapter.

      (2) The commission shall ascertain and fix adequate and serviceable standards for the measurement of quality, pressure, initial voltage or other conditions pertaining to the supply of the service rendered by any telecommunications utility and prescribe reasonable regulations for examination and testing of such service and for the measurement thereof. It shall establish reasonable rules, regulations, specifications and standards to secure the accuracy of all meters and appliances for the measurements, and every telecommunications utility is required to carry into effect all orders issued by the commission relative thereto. [1987 c.447 §20]

 

      759.245 Examination and testing of measuring appliances; rules; fees. (1) The Public Utility Commission may provide for the examination and testing of any and all appliances used for the measuring of any service of a telecommunications utility and may provide by rule that no such appliance shall be installed and used for the measuring of any service of any telecommunications utility until it has been examined and tested by the commission and found to be accurate.

      (2) The commission shall declare and establish a reasonable fee governing the cost of such examination and test, which shall be paid to the commission by the telecommunications utility.

      (3) The commission shall declare and establish reasonable fees for the testing of such appliances on the application of the customer, the fee to be paid by the customer at the time of the customer’s request, but to be repaid to the customer by the commission and to be paid by the telecommunications utility if the appliance is found defective or incorrect to the disadvantage of the customer or used beyond such reasonable limit as may be prescribed by the commission.

      (4) All fees collected under the provisions of this section shall be paid by the commission into the State Treasury.

      (5) The commission may purchase such materials, apparatus and standard measuring instruments for the examination and tests as the commission deems necessary. [1987 c.447 §21]

 

      759.250 Contracts for special services; procedure for filing and approval; subsequent review and investigation. (1) A telecommunications utility may enter into a contract with any customer for the provision of a telecommunications service that the Public Utility Commission determines is a new service with limited availability, is designed to respond to a unique customer requirement or is subject to competition. Contracts shall be for a stated time period, not to exceed five years. If a contract includes competitive and noncompetitive service elements, the noncompetitive service elements shall be unbundled and priced separately from all other facilities and service elements in the contract. Such noncompetitive service elements shall be made available to all purchasers under the same or substantially the same circumstances at the same rate, terms and conditions.

      (2) The telecommunications utility shall file any contract with the commission no later than 90 days following its effective date. At the customer’s request, the telecommunications utility shall file the contract at least 30 days in advance of the effective date. Notice of the filing of the contract shall be given by the commission to all persons who have filed with the commission a petition to receive such notice.

      (3) Contracts entered into under this section are not schedules of rates, tolls or charges within the meaning of ORS 759.175. A contract entered into under this section shall be enforceable by the contracting parties according to its terms, unless the contract has been rejected by the commission as provided in this section.

      (4) Notwithstanding ORS 759.175 to 759.185, the commission shall approve any contract for a telecommunications service entered into under this section if the commission finds the following:

      (a) The telecommunications service is a new service with limited availability, is designed to respond to a unique customer requirement or is subject to competition. In making the determination of whether a service is subject to competition, the commission shall consider whether the customer might reasonably have chosen an alternative to the telecommunications utility’s service.

      (b) The contracted price for the telecommunications service is above the long run incremental costs of providing such service during the term of the contract. In making this calculation for a contract that includes both competitive and noncompetitive service elements, the commission shall consider separately whether the competitive service elements are priced above the long run incremental costs of providing such service elements.

      (c) The contracted price for the telecommunications service includes all costs of providing such service, including the rate that would be charged by a telecommunications utility to any competitive telecommunications provider for any component essential to the competitive telecommunications provider’s ability to offer the telecommunications service. The commission shall determine which components of the service shall be deemed essential and the method to include prices of those components in costs of such services.

      (5) The commission shall issue an order regarding any contract filed under subsection (2) of this section within 90 days of the filing. If the commission does not act within 90 days of the filing, the contract shall be deemed approved. If the commission disapproves the contract, it shall enter an order describing the ways in which the contract fails to meet the standards set forth in subsection (4) of this section and declaring the contract null and void. The telecommunications utility or customer may request that the commission hold a hearing to determine whether the order should continue in effect. Any such request for hearing shall be submitted to the commission not later than 15 days after the date of service of the order, and the commission shall hold the hearing not later than 60 days after receipt of such request for hearing.

      (6) Notwithstanding ORS 192.311 to 192.478, the commission shall not disclose the identity of a customer or any customer proprietary information contained in a contract filed under subsection (2) of this section without the consent of the customer and the telecommunications utility.

      (7) No contract filed under subsection (2) of this section may be automatically renewed. A contract renewal shall be treated as a new contract.

      (8) Nothing in this section shall be deemed state action for the purpose of exempting a telecommunications utility from liability for anticompetitive conduct or other unlawful practices.

      (9) Any contract executed prior to September 29, 1991, and approved by the commission is deemed lawful and shall be enforceable by the contracting parties according to its terms. A contract renewal shall be deemed a new contract.

      (10) Nothing in this section shall restrict the commission from subsequent scrutiny of the reasonableness of contracts filed under this section for ratemaking purposes.

      (11) In accordance with ORS 756.515, the commission may investigate contracts filed by a specific telecommunications utility under this section. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if the commission finds that contracts entered into by a telecommunications utility have not generally been in the public interest, the commission, by order, may prevent or restrict the telecommunications utility from future contracting pursuant to this section and may require the telecommunications utility to file contracts under ORS 759.175. [1991 c.527 §2]

 

      759.255 Setting prices without regard to return on utility investment; petition; findings; conditions; application of statutes to approved plan. (1) In addition to powers vested in the Public Utility Commission under ORS 759.195, and subject to the limitations contained in subsections (2) to (4) of this section, upon petition of a telecommunications utility that provides local exchange service directly, or is affiliated with a utility that provides local exchange service, the commission, after notice and hearing, may approve a plan under which the commission regulates prices charged by the utility, without regard to the return on investment of the utility. Prices approved under the plan are not subject to the provisions of ORS 759.180 to 759.190 and shall become effective as stated in the plan.

      (2) Prior to granting a petition to approve a plan under subsection (1) of this section, the commission must find that the plan is in the public interest. In making its determination the commission shall consider, among other matters, whether the plan:

      (a) Ensures prices for telecommunications services that are just and reasonable;

      (b) Ensures high quality of existing telecommunications services and makes new services available;

      (c) Maintains the appropriate balance between the need for regulation and competition; and

      (d) Simplifies regulation.

      (3) If the commission approves a plan under subsection (1) of this section, the commission shall establish objectives of the plan and conditions for review of the plan during the operation of the plan. The commission may not consider return on investment of the utility when the commission establishes objectives of the plan and conditions for review of the plan during the operation of the plan.

      (4) A rate for any service in the plan authorized under subsection (1) of this section may not be lower than the total service long run incremental cost, for nonessential functions, of providing the service and the charges of essential functions used in providing the service. However, the commission may allow a telecommunications utility to establish rates for residential local exchange service at any level necessary to achieve the commission’s universal service objectives.

      (5) If the commission approves a plan under subsection (1) of this section, the commission may waive, in whole or in part, compliance by the telecommunications utility with ORS 759.120, 759.125, 759.130, 759.135, 759.180 to 759.205, 759.215, 759.220, 759.285 and 759.300 to 759.393. [1995 c.399 §2; 2005 c.232 §13b]

 

      759.257 Extended area service: Portland to Scappoose. (1) Two-way, flat rate or measured extended area service shall be provided by each telecommunications utility providing service between the Portland EAS Region and the Scappoose Exchange, as described by EAS and exchange maps filed with and approved by the Public Utility Commission.

      (2) The service provided for in subsection (1) of this section may be implemented during the currently pending Portland EAS Region Expansion, but in no event shall such implementation occur later than November 1, 1998.

      (3) Nothing in subsection (1) of this section authorizes a telecommunications utility to discontinue two-way, flat rate or measured extended area service in any exchange area where that service was provided prior to October 4, 1997. [1997 c.796 §2]

 

      759.259 Extended area service: Portland to Molalla. (1) Two-way, flat rate or measured extended area service shall be provided by each telecommunications utility providing service between the Portland EAS Region and the Molalla Exchange, as described by EAS and exchange maps filed with and approved by the Public Utility Commission.

      (2) The service provided for in subsection (1) of this section may be implemented during the currently pending Portland EAS Region Expansion, but in no event shall such implementation occur later than November 1, 1998, after approval by customers of the Molalla Exchange.

      (3) Nothing in subsection (1) of this section authorizes a telecommunications utility to discontinue two-way, flat rate or measured extended area service in any exchange area where the service was provided prior to October 4, 1997. [1997 c.505 §2]

 

ILLEGAL PRACTICES

 

      759.260 Unjust discrimination in rates. (1) Except as provided in ORS 759.265, no telecommunications utility or any agent or officer thereof shall, directly or indirectly, by any device, charge, demand, collect or receive from any person a greater or less compensation for any service rendered or to be rendered by it than:

      (a) That prescribed in the public schedules or tariffs then in force or established; or

      (b) It charges, demands, collects or receives from any other person for a like and contemporaneous service under substantially similar circumstances. A difference in rates or charges based upon a difference in classification pursuant to ORS 759.210 shall not constitute a violation of this paragraph.

      (2) Any telecommunications utility violating this section is guilty of unjust discrimination. [1987 c.447 §46; 1989 c.5 §22; 1993 c.18 §165]

 

      759.265 Practices not constituting unjust discrimination. (1) ORS 759.260 does not prevent any telecommunications utility from giving free service, or reduced rates therefor, to:

      (a) Its officers, directors, employees and members of their families;

      (b) Former employees of such telecommunications utilities or members of their families where such former employees have become disabled in the service of such telecommunications utility or are unable from physical disqualification, including retirement, to continue in the service; or

      (c) Members of families of deceased employees of such telecommunications utility.

      (2) The Public Utility Commission may require any telecommunications utility to file with the commission a list, verified under oath, of all free or reduced rate privileges granted by a telecommunications utility under the provisions of this section. [1987 c.447 §47]

 

      759.267 Service promotion activities. A telecommunications utility may promote the use of its services by offering a waiver of part or all of a recurring or a nonrecurring charge, a redemption coupon or a premium with the purchase of a service. ORS 759.260 and 759.265 do not apply to promotions under this section, but the customer group to which the promotion is available must be based on reasonable distinctions among customers. [1993 c.204 §4]

 

      759.270 Reducing rates for persons furnishing part of facilities; rental of customer facilities; furnishing meters and appliances. (1) No telecommunications utility shall demand, charge, collect or receive from any person less compensation for any service rendered or to be rendered by the telecommunications utility in consideration of the furnishing by such person of any part of the facilities incident thereto.

      (2) This section does not prohibit any telecommunications utility from renting any customer’s facilities incident to providing its services and for paying a reasonable rental therefor.

      (3) This section does not require a telecommunications utility to furnish any part of such appliances which are situated in and upon the premises of any customer, except meters and appliances for measurements of any service, unless otherwise ordered by the Public Utility Commission. [1987 c.447 §48]

 

      759.275 Undue preferences and prejudices. (1) No telecommunications utility shall make or give undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person or locality, or shall subject any particular person or locality to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respect.

      (2) Any telecommunications utility violating this section is guilty of unjust discrimination. [1987 c.447 §49]

 

      759.280 Soliciting or accepting rebates or special advantage. No person shall knowingly solicit, accept or receive any rebate, concession or discrimination in respect to any service whereby any such service shall, by any device, be rendered free or at a lesser rate than that named in the published schedules and tariffs in force, or whereby any service or advantage is received other than authorized in this chapter. [1987 c.447 §50]

 

      759.285 Charging rates based on cost of property not presently providing service. No telecommunications utility shall, directly or indirectly, by any device, charge, demand, collect or receive from any customer, rates which are derived from a rate base which includes within it any construction, building, installation or real or personal property not presently used for providing utility service to the customer. [1987 c.447 §51]

 

      759.290 [1989 c.621 §2; repealed by 2007 c.823 §6]

 

ISSUANCE OF SECURITIES

 

      759.300 “Stocks” defined. As used in ORS 759.300 to 759.360, “stocks” means stocks, stock certificates or other evidence of interest or ownership. [1987 c.447 §28]

 

      759.305 Power to regulate issuance of telecommunications stocks; rules. The power of telecommunications utilities to issue stocks and bonds, notes and other evidences of indebtedness and to create liens on their property situated within this state is a special privilege, the right of supervision, regulation, restriction and control of which is and shall continue to be vested in the state. Such power shall be exercised as provided by law and under such rules and regulations as the Public Utility Commission may prescribe. [1987 c.447 §29]

 

      759.310 When issuance of securities void. All stocks and bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness and any security of a telecommunications utility shall be void when issued:

      (1) Without an order of the Public Utility Commission authorizing the same then in effect except as provided in ORS 759.315 (3) or (5).

      (2) With the authorization of the commission, but not conforming in its provisions to the provisions, if any, which it is required by the order of authorization of the commission to contain; but no failure to comply with the terms or conditions of the order of authorization of the commission and no informality or defect in the application or in the proceedings in connection therewith or with the issuance of such order shall render void any stock or bond, note or other evidence of indebtedness, or security issued pursuant to and in substantial conformity with an order of the commission, except as to a person taking the same otherwise than in good faith and for value and without actual notice. [1987 c.447 §30; 1993 c.204 §1]

 

      759.315 Purposes for which securities may be issued; order required; exceptions; rules. (1) A telecommunications utility may issue stocks and bonds, notes and other evidences of indebtedness, and securities for the following purposes and no others, except as otherwise permitted by subsection (4) of this section:

      (a) The acquisition of property, or the construction, completion, extension or improvement of its facilities.

      (b) The improvement or maintenance of its service.

      (c) The discharge or lawful refunding of its obligations.

      (d) The reimbursement of money actually expended from income or from any other money in the treasury of the telecommunications utility not secured by or obtained from the issue of stocks or bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness, or securities of such telecommunications utility, for any of the purposes listed in paragraphs (a) to (c) of this subsection except the maintenance of service and replacements, in cases where the applicant has kept its accounts and vouchers for such expenditures in such manner as to enable the Public Utility Commission to ascertain the amount of money so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made.

      (e) The compliance with terms and conditions of options granted to its employees to purchase its stock, if the commission first finds that such terms and conditions are reasonable and in the public interest.

      (2) Before issuing such securities, a telecommunications utility, in addition to the other requirements of law, shall secure from the commission upon application an order authorizing such issue, stating:

      (a) The amount of the issue and the purposes to which the issue or the proceeds thereof are to be applied;

      (b) In the opinion of the commission, the money, property or labor to be procured or paid for by such issue reasonably is required for the purposes specified in the order and compatible with the public interest, which is necessary or appropriate for or consistent with the proper performance by the applicant of service as a telecommunications utility, and will not impair its ability to perform that service; and

      (c) Except as otherwise permitted in the order in the case of bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness, such purposes are not, in whole or in part, reasonably chargeable to operating expenses or to income.

      (3) This section and ORS 759.310 apply to demand notes but do not apply to the issuance or renewal of a note or evidence of indebtedness maturing not more than one year after date of such issue or renewal.

      (4) Nothing in ORS 759.300 to 759.360 shall prevent issuance of stock to stockholders as a stock dividend if there has been secured from the commission an order:

      (a) Finding that the stock dividend is compatible with the public interest;

      (b) Authorizing such issue and a transfer of surplus to capital in any amount equal to the par or stated value of the stock so authorized; and

      (c) Finding that a sum equal to the amount to be so transferred was expended for the purposes enumerated in subsection (1) of this section.

      (5) A telecommunications utility that derives one-half or more of its gross revenue from sources outside this state does not require commission authorization to issue stocks and bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness and any security unless the commission finds that the authorization requirements of ORS 759.310 and subsection (2) of this section are necessary to:

      (a) Prevent the telecommunications utility from issuing securities for purposes not permitted under subsection (1) of this section; or

      (b) Prevent impairment of the telecommunications utility’s ability to provide telecommunications utility services to its customers in this state. The commission shall adopt rules that set forth independently determined financial indicators upon which the commission must base any finding of impaired ability to provide utility telecommunications services. [1987 c.447 §31; 1993 c.204 §2; 2001 c.236 §1]

 

      759.320 Application of ORS 759.315. ORS 759.315 does not apply to the issuance, renewal or assumption of liability on any evidence of indebtedness when such issuance, renewal or assumption is for the purpose of acquiring specific real or personal property, if the aggregate principal amount thereof, together with all other then outstanding evidences of indebtedness issued, renewed or assumed under this section, does not exceed whichever is the greater of the following amounts:

      (1) The amount of $75,000.

      (2) The amount of one-half of one percent of the sum of:

      (a) The total principal amount of all bonds or other securities representing secured indebtedness of the telecommunications utility issued or assumed and then outstanding; and

      (b) The capital and surplus as then stated on the books of account of the telecommunications utility. [1987 c.447 §32]

 

      759.325 Application of ORS 759.375. ORS 759.375 does not apply to any mortgage or other encumbrance upon any real or personal property given to secure payment of any evidence of indebtedness issued under ORS 759.315. [1987 c.447 §33]

 

      759.330 Hearings and supplemental orders for securities issuance; joint approval for issuance by utility operating in another state. (1) To enable the Public Utility Commission to determine whether the commission will issue an order under ORS 759.315, the commission may hold a hearing and may make such additional inquiry or investigation, examine such witnesses, books, papers, documents and contracts and require the filing of such data as the commission deems necessary. The application for such order shall be given priority and shall be disposed of by the commission within 30 days after the filing of such application, unless that period is extended with the consent of the telecommunications utility.

      (2) The commission may, upon application of the telecommunications utility, after opportunity for hearing and for good cause shown, make such supplemental orders in the premises as the commission finds necessary or appropriate, and may by any such supplemental order modify the provisions of any previous order as to the particular purposes, uses, extent to which, or the condition under which, any security theretofore authorized or its proceeds may be applied. Such supplemental orders are subject to the requirements of ORS 759.315. The period of time permitted under subsection (1) of this section for disposing of applications shall not apply to supplemental orders.

      (3) If a commission or other agency is empowered by another state to regulate and control the amount and character of securities to be issued by any telecommunications utility within such other state, the commission of Oregon has power to agree with such commission or agency of such other state on the issue of stocks, bonds, notes, other evidences of indebtedness or securities by a telecommunications utility owning or operating a telecommunications utility both in such state and in this state, and has power to approve such issue jointly with such commission or agency and to issue a joint certificate of such approval. However, no such joint approval is required in order to express the consent to and approval of such issue by the State of Oregon if the issue is separately approved by the Oregon commission. [1987 c.447 §34]

 

      759.335 Obligation of state as consequence of approval of issuance. No provision of ORS 759.300 to 759.360, and no deed or act done or performed under or in connection therewith, shall be held or construed to obligate the State of Oregon to pay or guarantee, in any manner whatsoever, any stock or bond, note or other evidence of indebtedness, authorized, issued or executed under the provisions of ORS 759.300 to 759.360. [1987 c.447 §35]

 

      759.340 Conditional approval of issuance. The Public Utility Commission may by order grant permission for the issue of stocks or bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness in the amount applied for, or in a lesser amount, or not at all, and may attach to the exercise of the permission such condition or conditions as the commission deems reasonable and necessary. [1987 c.447 §36]

 

      759.345 Use of proceeds from issuance; accounting; rules. (1) No telecommunications utility shall, without the consent of the Public Utility Commission, apply the issue of any stock or bond, note or other evidence of indebtedness, or any part or proceeds thereof, to any purpose not specified in the commission’s order, or to any purpose specified in the commission’s order in excess of the amount authorized for such purpose, or issue or dispose of the same on any terms less favorable than those specified in such order, or a modification thereof.

      (2) The commission has power to require telecommunications utilities to account for the disposition of the proceeds of all sales of stocks and bonds, notes and other evidences of indebtedness, in such form and detail as the commission deems advisable, and to establish such rules and regulations as the commission deems reasonable and necessary to insure the disposition of such proceeds for the purpose or purposes specified in the order. [1987 c.447 §37]

 

      759.350 Limitation on authority of utility to guarantee debt of another. No telecommunications utility shall assume any obligation or liability as guarantor, indorser, surety or otherwise in respect to the securities of any other person, firm or corporation, when such securities are payable at periods of more than 12 months after the date thereof, without first having secured from the Public Utility Commission an order authorizing it to do so. Every assumption made other than in accordance with such an order is void. [1987 c.447 §38]

 

      759.355 Issuance or use of proceeds contrary to commission order. No telecommunications utility shall directly or indirectly, issue or cause to be issued any stock or bond, note or other evidence of indebtedness in nonconformity with the order of the Public Utility Commission authorizing the same or contrary to the provisions of ORS 759.300 to 759.360, or of the Constitution of this state, or apply the proceeds from the sale thereof, or any part thereof, to any purpose other than the purposes specified in the commission’s order, or to any purpose specified in the commission’s order, in excess of the amount in the order authorized for such purpose. [1987 c.447 §39]

 

      759.360 Prohibited acts regarding issuance of securities. No person shall:

      (1) Knowingly authorize, direct, aid in, issue or execute, or cause to be issued or executed, any stock or bond, note or other evidence of indebtedness, in nonconformity with the order of the Public Utility Commission authorizing the same, or contrary to the provisions of ORS 759.300 to 759.360 or of the Constitution of this state.

      (2) In any proceeding before the commission, knowingly make any false statement or representation or with knowledge of its falsity file or cause to be filed with the commission any false statement or representation which may tend in any way to influence the commission to make an order authorizing the issue of any stock or bond, note or other evidence of indebtedness, or which results in procuring from the commission the making of any such order.

      (3) With knowledge that any false statement or representation was made to the commission in any proceeding tending in any way to influence the commission to make such order, issue, execute or negotiate, or cause to be issued, executed or negotiated, any stock or bond, note or other evidence of indebtedness.

      (4) Directly or indirectly, knowingly apply, or cause or assist to be applied, the proceeds, or any part thereof, from the sale of any stock or bond, note or other evidence of indebtedness, to any purpose not specified in the commission’s order, or to any purpose specified in the commission’s order in excess of the amount authorized for such purpose.

      (5) With knowledge that any stock or bond, note or other evidence of indebtedness, has been issued or executed in violation of ORS 759.300 to 759.360, negotiate, or cause the same to be negotiated. [1987 c.447 §40]

      (c) By any means whatsoever, directly or indirectly, merge or consolidate any of its lines, plant, system or other property whatsoever, or franchise or permit to maintain or operate any telecommunications utility property, or perform any service as a telecommunications utility, or any part thereof, with any other public utility or telecommunications utility.

      (2) A telecommunications utility that sells, leases, assigns or otherwise disposes of the whole of the property of such telecommunications utility necessary or useful in the performance of its duties to the public or any part thereof of a value in excess of $25,000, but less than $100,000, shall notify the commission of the sale within 60 days following the date of the sale.

      (3) Every sale, lease, assignment, mortgage, disposition, encumbrance, merger or consolidation subject to subsection (1) of this section made other than in accordance with the order of the commission authorizing the same is void.

      (4) This section does not prohibit or invalidate the sale, lease or other disposition by any telecommunications utility of property which is not necessary or useful in the performance of its duties to the public. [1987 c.447 §41; 1999 c.530 §2]

 

      759.380 Purchase of stock or property of another utility. (1) No telecommunications utility shall, directly or indirectly, purchase, acquire or become the owner of any of the stocks or bonds or property utilized for utility purposes and having a value in excess of $10,000 of any other public utility or telecommunications utility unless authorized to do so by the Public Utility Commission.

      (2) Every contract by any telecommunications utility for the purchase, acquisition, assignment or transfer to it of any of the stock of any other telecommunications utility by or through any person, partnership or corporation without the approval of the commission shall be void and of no effect, and no such transfer or assignment of such stock upon the books of the corporation pursuant to any such contract is effective for any purpose. [1987 c.447 §42]

 

      759.385 Contracts regarding use of utility property; filing with commission; investigation. (1) When any telecommunications utility doing business in this state, except a telecommunications carrier that has elected to be subject to ORS 759.405 and 759.410, enters into a contract with another corporation with relation to the construction, operation, maintenance or use of the property of the telecommunications utility in Oregon, or the use of the property of the other contracting party, or any part of the property, or for service, advice, engineering, financing, rentals, leasing or for any construction or management charges with respect to any of the property, or for the purchase of property, materials or supplies, the proposed contract shall be filed with the Public Utility Commission for investigation and approval when the telecommunications utility owns a majority of or controls directly or indirectly the voting stock of the other contracting corporations.

      (2) Any proposed contract described in subsection (1) of this section shall be filed with the commission within 90 days of execution of the contract. The contract shall be deemed to be executed on the date the parties sign a written contract or on the date the parties begin to transact business under the contract, whichever date is earlier. The commission shall promptly investigate and act upon the contract in accordance with ORS 759.390 (4) and (7).

      (3) In making an investigation of the contract, the commission and accountants, examiners and agents, appointed by the commission for the purpose, shall be given free access to all books, books of account, documents, data and records of the telecommunications utility, as well as of the corporation with which it is proposing to contract, that the commission may deem material to the investigation. The failure or refusal of either of the parties to the proposed contract to comply with this subsection is prima facie evidence that the contract is unfair, unreasonable and contrary to public interest, and is sufficient to justify a determination and finding of the commission to that effect. A determination and finding by the commission under this subsection has the same force and effect as any other determination or order of the commission.

      (4) This section applies only to transactions in which the telecommunications utility’s Oregon intrastate expenditure to the affiliate is more than $100,000. [1987 c.447 §43; 1989 c.956 §4; 1991 c.899 §1; 1999 c.809 §1; 2005 c.232 §21; 2009 c.11 §97]

 

      759.390 Contracts with affiliated interests; procedure; use in rate proceedings. (1) As used in this section, “affiliated interest” with a telecommunications utility means:

      (e) Every corporation that has two or more officers or two or more directors in common with the telecommunications utility.

      (f) Every entity, five percent or more of which is directly or indirectly owned by a telecommunications utility.

      (g) Every person that the Public Utility Commission determines as a matter of fact, after investigation and hearing, actually is exercising any substantial influence over the policies and actions of the telecommunications utility, even though the influence is not based upon stockholdings, stockholders, directors or officers to the extent specified in this section.

      (h) Every person that the commission determines as a matter of fact, after investigation and hearing, actually is exercising such substantial influence over the policies and actions of the telecommunications utility in conjunction with one or more other persons with whom they are related by ownership or blood or by action in concert that together they are affiliated with the telecommunications utility within the meaning of this section even though no one of them alone is so affiliated.

      (2) When any telecommunications utility doing business in this state, except a telecommunications carrier that has elected to be subject to ORS 759.405 and 759.410, enters into any contract to make any payment, directly or indirectly, to any person having an affiliated interest, for service, advice, auditing, accounting, sponsoring, engineering, managing, operating, financing, legal or other services, or enters any charge on the books of the utility, and the contract is to be recognized as an operating expense or capital expenditure in any rate valuation or any other hearing or proceeding, the contract shall be filed with the commission within 90 days of execution of the contract. The contract shall be deemed to be executed on the date the parties sign a written contract or on the date the parties begin to transact business under the contract, whichever date is earlier.

      (3) When any telecommunications utility doing business in this state enters into any contract, oral or written, with any person having an affiliated interest relating to the construction, operation, maintenance, leasing or use of the property of the telecommunications utility in Oregon, or the purchase of property, materials or supplies that is to be recognized as the basis of an operating expense or capital expenditure in any rate valuation or any other hearing or proceeding, the contract shall be filed with the commission within 90 days of execution of the contract. The contract shall be deemed to be executed on the date the parties sign a written contract or on the date the parties begin to transact business under the contract, whichever date is earlier.

      (4) The commission promptly shall examine and investigate any contract submitted to the commission under subsection (2) or (3) of this section. If, after the investigation, the commission determines that it is fair and reasonable and not contrary to the public interest, the commission shall enter findings and order approving the contract and serve a copy of the findings and order upon the telecommunications utility. Following the commission’s determination of fairness and reasonableness, any expenses and capital expenditures incurred by the telecommunications utility under the contract may be recognized in any rate valuation or other hearing or proceeding. If, after the investigation, the commission determines that the contract is not fair and reasonable in all its terms and is contrary to the public interest, the commission shall enter findings and order disapproving the contract and serve a copy of the findings and order upon the telecommunications utility. Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, it is unlawful to recognize a disapproved contract for the purposes specified in this section.

      (5) When any contract described in subsection (2) or (3) of this section has been filed with the commission within 90 days of execution and the commission has not entered an order disapproving the contract under subsection (4) of this section, the commission may not base its refusal to recognize any expenses or capital expenditures incurred under the contract in any rate valuation or other hearing or proceeding solely on the basis that the contract has not been approved under subsection (4) of this section.

      (6) A telecommunications utility may not issue notes or loan its funds or give credit on its books or otherwise to any person having an affiliated interest, either directly or indirectly, without the approval of the commission.

      (7) The action of the commission with respect to all the matters described in this section shall be by findings and order to be entered within 90 days after the matter has been submitted to the commission for consideration. An order of the commission under this section is subject to judicial review in the manner provided by ORS 756.610.

      (8) This section applies only to transactions in which the telecommunications utility’s Oregon intrastate expenditure to the affiliate is more than $100,000. [1987 c.447 §44; 1989 c.956 §5; 1991 c.899 §2; 1999 c.809 §2; 2005 c.232 §22; 2005 c.638 §16a; 2017 c.312 §10]

(1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the filing of proposed contracts under ORS 759.385 and 759.390 shall constitute a telecommunications utility’s sole reporting obligation under ORS 759.385 and 759.390 and the Public Utility Commission may not require a telecommunications utility to submit annual or other cumulative reports regarding such contracts, including contracts with affiliates of the utility.

      (2) On April 1 of each year, every telecommunications utility shall file with the commission a list of affiliate contracts executed in the preceding year. The list shall consist of the names of the parties to the contracts, the dollar amounts of the contracts and the dates of execution of the contracts. [1999 c.809 §3]

      (4) Nothing in this section affects the authority of a city or municipality to manage the public rights of way or to require fair and reasonable compensation from a telecommunications carrier, on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis, under ORS 221.420, 221.450, 221.510 and 221.515. [1999 c.1093 §24; 2001 c.104 §295]

 

      759.410 Intent of ORS 759.410; establishing maximum and minimum price for telecommunications services; packaging services; notice of price change, new service; enforcement. (1) It is the intent of the Legislative Assembly that:

      (a) The State of Oregon cease regulation of telecommunications carriers on a rate of return basis;

      (b) Telecommunications carriers subject to rate of return regulation have the ability to opt out of rate of return regulation;

      (c) A telecommunications carrier that opts out of rate of return regulation under this section and ORS 759.405 shall be subject to price cap regulation and the carrier under price cap regulation shall continue to meet service quality requirements; and

      (d) Telecommunications carriers that opt out of rate of return regulation under this section and ORS 759.405 shall make payments to the state to support the use of advanced telecommunications services and to support deployment of advanced telecommunications services.

      (2) A telecommunications carrier that elects to be subject to this section and ORS 759.405 shall be subject to price regulation as provided in this section and shall not be subject to any other retail rate regulation, including but not limited to any form of earnings-based, rate-based or rate of return regulation.

      (3) The price a telecommunications utility that elects to be subject to this section and ORS 759.405 may charge for basic telephone service shall be established by the Public Utility Commission under ORS 759.425. Subject to ORS 759.415, the regular tariff rate of intrastate switched access and retail telecommunications services regulated by the commission, other than basic telephone service, in effect on the date the carrier elects to be subject to this section and ORS 759.405 shall be the maximum price the telecommunications carrier may charge for that service.

      (4) A telecommunications carrier that elects to be subject to this section and ORS 759.405 may adjust the price for intrastate switched access or a regulated retail telecommunications service between the maximum price established under this section and a price floor equal to the sum of the total service long run incremental cost of providing the service for the nonessential functions of the service and the price that is charged to other telecommunications carriers for the essential functions. Basic telephone service shall not be subject to a price floor.

      (5) The price for a new regulated retail telecommunications service introduced by a telecommunications carrier within four years after the date the carrier elects to be subject to this section and ORS 759.405 shall be subject to a price floor test by the commission to ensure that the service is not priced below the sum of the total service long run incremental cost of providing the service for the nonessential functions of the service and the price that is charged to other telecommunications carriers for the essential functions. Beginning on the date four years after September 1, 1999, the price of a new telecommunications service shall be subject to a price floor test by the commission to ensure that the service is not priced below the total service long run incremental cost of providing the service, without regard to whether the service is considered essential or nonessential.

      (6) A telecommunications carrier that elects to be subject to this section and ORS 759.405 may package and offer any of its retail telecommunications services with any other service at any price, provided the following conditions apply:

      (a) Any regulated telecommunications service may be purchased separately at or below the maximum price.

      (b) The price of the package is not less than the sum of the price floors of each regulated retail telecommunications service included in the package.

      (c) The price of a package that is comprised entirely of regulated retail telecommunications services does not exceed the sum of the maximum prices for each of the services.

      (d) The price of a package comprised of regulated and unregulated retail telecommunications services does not exceed the sum of the maximum prices established under this section for regulated services and the retail price charged by the carrier for the individual unregulated services in the package. A telecommunications carrier subject to regulation under this section shall provide notice to the commission within 30 days of a change in the price of an unregulated telecommunications service contained in the package.

      (7) Nothing in this section or ORS 759.405 is intended to limit the ability of a telecommunications carrier to seek deregulation of telecommunications services under ORS 759.052.

      (8)(a) Notice of a price change authorized under subsection (4) of this section, of the introduction of a new regulated telecommunications service or of the packaging of services, must be given to the commission within 30 days following the effective date of the price change, new service or packaged service. Notice of a new regulated telecommunications service shall indicate the retail price charged by the carrier for the service.

      (b) The commission may investigate any price change authorized under subsection (4) of this section, the price of a new regulated telecommunications service or the price of a package of services to determine that the price complies with the provisions of this section and any other applicable law. If the commission determines that the price of the service or package of services does not comply with the provisions of this section or other applicable law, the commission may order the telecommunications carrier to take such action as the commission determines necessary to bring the price into compliance with this section or other applicable law.

      (9) Nothing in this section affects the authority of a city or municipality to manage the public rights of way or to require fair and reasonable compensation from a telecommunications carrier, on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis, under ORS 221.420, 221.450, 221.510 and 221.515.

      (10) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the commission shall establish prices for extended area service in a manner that allows a telecommunications carrier that elects to be subject to this section and ORS 759.405 to recover all costs and lost net revenues attributable to implementing new extended area service routes. The provisions of this subsection apply to telecommunications service provided on a flat or measured basis between exchanges defined by exchange maps filed with and approved by the commission.

      759.415 Order in rate proceeding filed prior to January 1, 1999, to establish maximum rate for affected telecommunications services; dismissal of rate proceeding filed after January 1, 1999. (1) In a rate proceeding brought by a telecommunications carrier that elects to be subject to ORS 759.405 and 759.410, or by the Public Utility Commission against an electing telecommunications carrier, prior to January 1, 1999, that is on appeal on September 1, 1999, a final rate for a telecommunications service implemented as a result of the final judgment and order or negotiated settlement shall become the maximum rate for purposes of ORS 759.410.

      (2) A rate proceeding brought by or against an electing telecommunications carrier, after January 1, 1999, that is pending on the effective date of the carrier’s election to be subject to ORS 759.405 and 759.410, shall be dismissed by the commission or by the court if on appeal, provided the carrier elects to be subject to regulation under ORS 759.405 and 759.410 within the later of:

(Universal Service Fund)

 

      759.425 Universal service fund; commission to establish price for basic telephone service; universal service surcharge; application to cellular services; rules. (1) For purposes of this section, “retail telecommunications service” does not include radio communications service, radio paging service, commercial mobile radio service, personal communications service or cellular communications service.

      (2)(a) The Public Utility Commission shall establish and implement a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory universal service fund. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the Public Utility Commission shall use the universal service fund to ensure basic telephone service is available at a reasonable and affordable rate. The Public Utility Commission may adopt rules to conform the universal service fund to section 254 of the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-104), and to related regulations adopted by the Federal Communications Commission, to the extent that the Public Utility Commission determines conforming the rules is appropriate.

      (b) In addition to using the universal service fund to ensure basic telephone service, the Public Utility Commission may use the universal service fund to encourage broadband service availability and to provide support to telecommunications carriers that provide both basic telephone service and broadband service.

      (3)(a) The Public Utility Commission shall establish the price a telecommunications utility may charge its customers for basic telephone service. The commission shall periodically review and evaluate the status of telecommunications services in the state and designate the services included in basic telephone service. The commission shall periodically review and adjust as necessary the price a telecommunications utility may charge for basic telephone service.

      (b) The provisions of this subsection do not apply to the basic telephone service provided by a telecommunications utility described in ORS 759.040.

      (4)(a) The commission shall establish a benchmark for basic telephone service as necessary for the administration and distribution of the universal service fund. The universal service fund shall provide explicit support to an eligible telecommunications carrier that is equal to the difference between the cost of providing basic telephone service and the benchmark, less any explicit compensation received by the telecommunications carrier from federal sources specifically used to recover local loop costs and less any explicit support received by the telecommunications carrier from a federal universal service program.

      (b) The commission shall periodically review the benchmark established under paragraph (a) of this subsection and adjust the benchmark as necessary to reflect:

      (A) Changes in competition in the telecommunications industry;

      (B) Changes in federal universal service support; and

      (C) Other relevant factors as determined by the commission.

      (c) Except for a telecommunications utility described in ORS 759.040, the commission shall seek to limit the difference between the price a telecommunications utility may charge for basic telephone service and the benchmark.

      (5) There is imposed on the sale of all retail telecommunications services sold in this state a universal service surcharge. Unless otherwise provided by the commission by rule, the universal service surcharge must be a uniform percentage of the sale of retail telecommunications services in an amount sufficient to support the purposes of the universal service fund established under subsection (2) of this section, provided that the percentage does not exceed 8.5 percent of the sale of retail telecommunications services. The universal service surcharge may be listed as a separate line item by all telecommunications carriers, as prescribed by the commission by rule or order. A telecommunications carrier shall transmit amounts collected pursuant to this section to the commission in accordance with a schedule adopted by the commission. The commission shall deposit moneys transmitted to the commission pursuant to this subsection in the universal service fund established under subsection (2) of this section.

      (6) The universal service fund established under subsection (2) of this section is separate and distinct from the General Fund. The universal service fund shall consist of all universal service surcharge moneys collected by telecommunications carriers and transmitted to the commission for deposit in the universal service fund. The universal service fund may be used only for the purposes described in this section and for payment of expenses incurred by the commission or a third party appointed by the commission to administer this section. All moneys in the universal service fund are continuously appropriated to the commission to carry out the provisions of this section. Interest on moneys deposited in the universal service fund shall accrue to the universal service fund.

      (7) A person that primarily provides radio communications service, radio paging service, commercial mobile radio service, personal communications service or cellular communications service may request designation as an eligible telecommunications carrier by the commission for purposes of this section if the person imposes the universal service surcharge described in subsection (5) of this section and transmits the moneys collected to the commission for deposit in the universal service fund established under subsection (2) of this section for at least one year immediately prior to requesting the designation.

      (8) A pay telephone provider may apply to the commission, on a form developed by the commission, for a refund of the universal service surcharge imposed on the pay telephone provider under subsection (5) of this section for the provision of pay telephone service.

SERVICE QUALITY STANDARDS AND PROHIBITED ACTS

 

      759.450 Minimum service quality standards; rules; customer impact indices; factors; wholesale services; improvement plan; penalties; exceptions. (1) It is the intent of the Legislative Assembly that every telecommunications carrier and those telecommunications utilities and competitive telecommunications providers that provide wholesale services meet minimum service quality standards on a nondiscriminatory basis.

      (2) The Public Utility Commission shall determine minimum service quality standards that relate to the provision of retail telecommunications services to ensure safe and adequate service. Except as provided in subsections (8) and (9) of this section, minimum service quality standards adopted under this section shall apply to all telecommunications carriers. The commission by rule shall review and revise the minimum service quality standards as necessary to ensure safe and adequate retail telecommunications services.

      (3) The minimum service quality standards for providing retail telecommunications services adopted by the commission shall relate directly to specific customer impact indices including but not limited to held orders, trouble reports, repair intervals and carrier inquiry response times. In adopting minimum service quality standards, the commission shall, for each standard adopted, consider the following:

      (a) General industry practice and achievement;

      (b) National data for similar standards;

      (c) Normal operating conditions;

      (d) The historic purpose for which the telecommunications network was constructed;

      (e) Technological improvements and trends; and

      (f) Other factors as determined by the commission.

      (4) Consistent with the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-104), as amended and in effect on September 1, 1999, the commission may establish minimum service quality standards related to providing wholesale, interconnection, transport and termination services provided by a telecommunications carrier and those telecommunications utilities and competitive telecommunications providers that provide wholesale telecommunications services.

      (5) The commission shall require a telecommunications carrier, telecommunications utility or competitive telecommunications provider that is not meeting the minimum service quality standards to submit a plan for improving performance to meet the standards. The commission shall review and approve or disapprove the plan. If the carrier, utility or provider does not meet the goals of its improvement plan within six months or if the plan is disapproved by the commission, penalties may be assessed against the carrier, utility or provider on the basis of the carrier’s, utility’s or provider’s service quality measured against the minimum service quality standards and, if assessed, shall be assessed according to the provisions of ORS 759.990.

      (6) Prior to commencing an action under this section and ORS 759.990, the commission shall allow a telecommunications carrier, telecommunications utility or competitive telecommunications provider an opportunity to demonstrate that a violation of a minimum service quality standard is the result of the failure of a person providing telecommunications interconnection service to meet the person’s interconnection obligations.

      (7) Total annual penalties imposed on a telecommunications utility under this section shall not exceed two percent of the utility’s gross intrastate revenue from the sale of telecommunications services for the calendar year preceding the year in which the penalties are assessed. Total annual penalties imposed on a competitive telecommunications provider under this section shall not exceed two percent of the provider’s gross revenue from the sale of telecommunications services in this state for the calendar year preceding the year in which the penalties are imposed.

      759.455 Prohibited acts; commission action on allegation of violation; penalties; judicial review. (1) Unless exempt from compliance under section 251(f) of the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 (47 U.S.C. 251(f)), a telecommunications utility shall not:

      (a) Discriminate against another provider of retail telecommunications services by unreasonably refusing or delaying access to the telecommunications utility’s local exchange services.

      (b) Discriminate against another provider of retail telecommunications services by providing access to required facilities on terms or conditions less favorable than those the telecommunications utility provides to itself and its affiliates. A telecommunications facility, feature or function is a required facility if:

      (A) Access to a proprietary facility, feature or function is necessary; and

      (B) Failure to provide access to the facility, feature or function would impair a telecommunications carrier seeking access from providing the services the carrier is seeking to provide.

      (f) Use basic exchange services rates, directly or indirectly, to subsidize or offset the cost of other products or services offered by the telecommunications utility.

      (g) Discriminate in favor of itself or an affiliate in the provision and pricing of, or extension of credit for, any telephone service.

      (h) Fail to provide a service, product or facility in accordance with applicable contracts, and tariffs and rules of the Public Utility Commission.

      (i) Impose unreasonable or discriminatory restrictions on network elements or the resale of its services, except that:

      (A) The telecommunications utility may require that residential service not be resold as a different class of service; and

      (B) The commission may prohibit the resale of services the commission has approved for provision to a not-for-profit entity at rates below those offered to the general public.

      (j) Provide telephone service to a person acting as a telecommunications provider if the commission has ordered the telecommunications utility to discontinue telephone service to the person.

      (2) A complaint alleging a violation of subsection (1) of this section shall be heard by the Public Utility Commission or, at the commission’s discretion, by an Administrative Law Judge designated by the commission. A hearing under this subsection shall be conducted in an expedited manner consistent with the following:

      (a) The complaint shall be served upon the telecommunications carrier and filed with the commission.

      (b) An answer or other responsive pleading to the complaint shall be filed with the commission not more than 10 days after receipt of the complaint. Copies of the answer or responsive pleading shall be served upon the complainant and upon the commission.

      (c) A prehearing conference shall be held not later than 15 days after the complaint is filed. Hearing on the complaint shall commence not later than 30 days after the complaint is filed.

      (3) If the commission or Administrative Law Judge finds that a violation of this section has occurred, the commission shall, within five business days, order the telecommunications utility to remedy the violation within a specified period of time. The commission may prescribe specific action to be taken by the utility, including but not limited to submitting a plan for preventing future violations. If the violation continues beyond the time period specified in the commission’s order, the commission on its own motion or upon the motion of an interested party may seek penalties as provided in ORS 759.990 or otherwise may seek enforcement under ORS 756.160 or 756.180, or both.

      (4) Total annual penalties imposed on a telecommunications utility under this section and ORS 759.450 shall not exceed two percent of the utility’s gross intrastate revenue from the sale of telecommunications services for the year preceding the year in which the violation occurred.

      (5) An order of the commission under this section is subject to judicial review in the manner provided by ORS 756.610.

      (6) The Court of Appeals shall give proceedings brought before the court under this section priority over all other matters before the court. [1999 c.1093 §38; 2005 c.638 §17; 2017 c.312 §11]

      (3) The commission, upon petition from a telecommunications utility, cooperative corporation or municipality, may exempt the telecommunications utility, cooperative corporation or municipality from the obligations described in this section if the commission finds, for a property with four or more single-family dwellings, that the owner or developer of the property, or a person acting on behalf of the owner or developer:

      (a) Permits an alternative service provider to install its facilities or equipment used to provide local telecommunications service based on a condition of exclusion of the telecommunications utility, cooperative corporation or municipality during the construction phase of the real property;

      (b) Accepts or agrees to accept incentives or rewards from an alternative service provider that are contingent upon the provision of any or all local telecommunications services by one or more alternative service providers to the exclusion of the telecommunications utility, cooperative corporation or municipality; or

      (c) Collects from the occupants or residents of the property mandatory charges for the provision of any local telecommunications service provided to the occupants or residents by an alternative service provider in any manner, including, but not limited to, collection through rent, fees or dues.

      (4) If the commission, upon petition from any interested person located within the property for which the commission has waived the carrier of last resort obligations under subsection (3) of this section, finds that the existing public convenience and necessity requires reinstatement of the carrier of last resort obligations, then the commission has the power to assign the obligations to a telecommunications utility, cooperative corporation or municipality after a public hearing. The commission shall determine how the costs of serving the customers are allocated so that the telecommunications utility, cooperative corporation or municipality will be allowed an opportunity to recover reasonable and prudent costs that exceed the costs that would have been incurred to initially construct or acquire facilities to serve customers of the territory. The determination of cost allocation by the commission must also divide the costs allowed equitably among all customers of the territory to which service is being reinstated.

      Sec. 27. As of January 1, 2006, the Public Utility Commission shall:

      (1) Reallocate every allocated local exchange telecommunications service territory to a telecommunications utility, cooperative corporation or municipality to whom the commission had previously allocated local exchange telecommunications service territory. Allocations granted by the commission pursuant to this subsection shall replace all allocations to telecommunications utilities, cooperative corporations or municipalities granted by the commission prior to January 1, 2006. An allocation made pursuant to this subsection is not subject to ORS 759.535 or 759.560. The commission has authority under ORS 756.500 to 756.610 to resolve a dispute arising from a reallocation made under this subsection.

      (2) Upon request, allocate every local exchange telecommunications service territory that is shown on a map approved by the commission and that is unallocated as of December 31, 2005, to the telecommunications utility, cooperative corporation or municipality that filed the map. An allocation made pursuant to this subsection is not subject to ORS 759.535 or 759.560. The commission has authority under ORS 756.500 to 756.610 to resolve a dispute arising from an allocation made under this subsection. [2005 c.232 §27]

      759.560 Assignment or transfer of allocated territory; rules. (1) The rights acquired by an allocation of territory may only be assigned or transferred with the approval of the Public Utility Commission after a finding that the assignment or transfer is not contrary to the public interest.

      (2) The commission may approve a transfer of territory previously allocated only upon receipt of an application for allocation that is jointly filed by the transferor and the transferee. The application shall include exchange maps that show how the applicants want the commission to allocate the territory. The commission shall enter an order either approving or disapproving the application as filed, or as amended, together with findings of fact supporting the order.

      (3)(a) An order approving an allocation of territory may not be construed to confer any property right.

      (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, upon the death of an individual to whom territory was allocated or who was an applicant under an approved order, the executor or administrator of the estate of the individual shall continue the operation of local exchange telecommunications service for the purpose of transferring territorial allocation rights. The executor or administrator shall continue the operation for a period not to exceed two years from the date of death.

      (4) In the event the property of a person serving an allocated territory is condemned, no value shall be claimed or awarded by reason of the contract or order making the allocation.

      (5) The commission may by rule establish requirements for notice to affected persons of the assignment or transfer of allocated territory. [1987 c.447 §65; 2005 c.232 §29]

(1) ORS 759.500 to 759.570 may not be construed or applied to restrict the powers granted to cities to issue franchises or to restrict the exercise of the power of condemnation by a municipality. If a municipality condemns or otherwise acquires equipment, plant or facilities from another person for rendering local exchange telecommunications service, the municipality acquires all of the rights of the person whose property is condemned to serve the territory served by the acquired properties.

      (2) ORS 759.500 to 759.570 may not be construed to restrict the right of a municipality to provide local exchange telecommunications service for street lights, fire alarm systems, airports, buildings and other municipal installations regardless of their location.

      (3) ORS 759.500 to 759.570 may not be construed to confer upon the Public Utility Commission any regulatory authority over rates, service or financing of cooperatives or municipalities. [1987 c.447 §67; 2005 c.232 §31]

(Unserved Territory)

 

      759.580 Power of commission to require service to unserved territory. The Public Utility Commission has power to require any telecommunications utility, after a public hearing of all parties interested, to extend its line, plant or system into, and to render service to, a locality not already served when the existing public convenience and necessity requires such extension and service. However, no such extension of service shall be required until the telecommunications utility has been granted such reasonable franchises as may be necessary for the extension of service and unless the conditions are such as to reasonably justify the necessary investment by the telecommunications utility in extending its line, plant or system into such locality and furnishing such service. [1987 c.447 §4]

 

      759.585 Definitions for ORS 759.585 to 759.595. As used in ORS 759.585 to 759.595, “unserved person” means a person:

      (1) Who does not have local exchange telecommunications service;

      759.590 Application for service by unserved person; rules. (1) An unserved person may file an application with the Public Utility Commission for an order directing another telecommunications utility to provide local exchange service to the unserved person.

      (2) The commission shall adopt rules which prescribe the form of an application filed under subsection (1) of this section and which provide for reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing to all telecommunications utilities affected by an application. [1989 c.574 §3; 1991 c.307 §2]

 

      759.595 Criteria for granting application for service; effect on other territorial allocation. (1) The Public Utility Commission shall grant an application filed under ORS 759.590 if the commission finds that:

      (a) The telecommunications utility in whose territory the unserved person is located has declined to serve without line extension charges;

      (b) Another telecommunications utility has agreed to provide local exchange telecommunications service to the unserved person with no line extension charge or with line extension charges lower than those offered by the telecommunications utility in whose territory the unserved person is located; and

      (c) Approval of the application is not contrary to the public interest.

      (2) Any order of the commission issued under subsection (1) of this section shall not have the effect of changing any territory allocated under ORS 758.400 to 758.475 that is being provided with local exchange telecommunications service. [1989 c.574 §4; 1991 c.307 §3]

ATTACHMENT REGULATION

 

      759.650 Definitions for ORS 759.650 to 759.675. As used in ORS 759.650 to 759.675, unless the context requires otherwise:

      (1) “Attachment” means any wire or cable for the transmission of intelligence by telegraph, telephone or television (including cable television), light waves or other phenomena, or for the transmission of electricity for light, heat or power, and any related device, apparatus or auxiliary equipment, installed upon any pole or in any telegraph, telephone, electrical, cable television or communications right of way, duct, conduit, manhole or handhole or other similar facility or facilities owned or controlled, in whole or in part, by one or more public utility, telecommunications utility or people’s utility district.

      (2) “Licensee” means any person, firm, corporation, partnership, company, association, joint stock association or cooperatively organized association which is authorized to construct attachments upon, along, under or across the public ways.

      (3) “People’s utility district” means any concern providing electricity organized pursuant to ORS 261.010 and includes any entity cooperatively organized or owned by federal, state or local government or a subdivision of state or local government.

      (4) “Public utility” has the meaning for that term provided in ORS 757.005, and does not include any entity cooperatively organized or owned by federal, state or local government or a subdivision of state or local government.

      (5) “Telecommunications utility” means any telecommunications utility as defined in ORS 759.005 and does not include any entity cooperatively organized or owned by federal, state or local government, or a subdivision of state or local government. [1987 c.447 §22; 1989 c.5 §18]

 

      759.655 Authority of commission to regulate attachments. The Public Utility Commission of Oregon shall have the authority to regulate in the public interest the rates, terms and conditions for attachments by licensees to poles or other facilities of telecommunications utilities. All rates, terms and conditions made, demanded or received by any telecommunications utility for any attachment by a licensee shall be just, fair and reasonable. [1987 c.447 §23]

 

      759.660 Fixing charges or rates; criteria; costs of hearing. (1) Whenever the Public Utility Commission of Oregon finds, after hearing had upon complaint by a licensee or people’s utility district or a telecommunications utility that the rates, terms or conditions demanded, exacted, charged or collected in connection with attachments or availability of surplus space for such attachments are unjust or unreasonable, or that such rates or charges are insufficient to yield a reasonable compensation for the attachment and the costs of administering the same, the commission shall determine the just and reasonable rates, terms and conditions thereafter to be observed and in force and shall fix the same by order. In determining and fixing such rates, terms and conditions, the commission shall consider the interest of the customers of the licensee, as well as the interest of the customers of the telecommunications utility or people’s utility district which owns the facility upon which the attachment is made.

      (2) When the order applies to a people’s utility district, the order also shall provide for payment by the parties of the cost of the hearing. The payment shall be made in a manner which the commission considers equitable. [1987 c.414 §166d; 1987 c.447 §24; 1989 c.5 §19]

 

      759.665 Considerations in determining just and reasonable rate.

[1987 c.447 §25]

 

      759.670 Presumption of reasonableness of rates set by agreement. Agreements regarding rates, terms and conditions of attachments shall be deemed to be just, fair and reasonable unless the Public Utility Commission finds upon complaint by a telecommunications utility, people’s utility district or licensee party to such agreement and after hearing, that such rates, terms and conditions are adverse to the public interest and fail to comply with the provisions hereof. [1987 c.447 §26; 1989 c.5 §20]

 

      759.675 Regulatory procedure. The procedures of the Public Utility Commission for petition, regulation and enforcement relative to attachments, including any rights of appeal from any decision thereof, shall be the same as those applicable to the commission. [1987 c.447 §27; 1989 c.5 §21]

(1)(a) In order to fund the programs provided in sections 2 to 6, chapter 290, Oregon Laws 1987, and ORS 759.693 to 759.698, the Public Utility Commission shall develop and implement a system for assessing a surcharge in an amount not to exceed 35 cents per month against each paying retail subscriber who has telecommunications service, or who has interconnected voice over internet protocol service, with access to a telecommunications relay service. The commission shall apply the surcharge on a telecommunications circuit designated for a particular subscriber. One subscriber line must be counted for each circuit that is capable of generating usage on the line side of the switched network regardless of the quantity of customer premises equipment connected to each circuit. For providers of central office based services, the surcharge must be applied to each line that has unrestricted connection to the telecommunications relay service or, for lines that have restricted access to the telecommunications relay service, on the basis of software design. For cellular, wireless or other radio common carriers, the surcharge must be applied on a per instrument basis and only to subscribers whose place of primary use, as defined and determined under 4 U.S.C. 116 to 126, is within this state.

      (b) For purposes of this subsection, the commission shall adopt by rule the definition for “interconnected voice over internet protocol service.” The rule defining “interconnected voice over internet protocol service” must be consistent with the definition for “interconnected VoIP service” in 47 C.F.R. 9.3.

      (2) The surcharge imposed by subsection (1) of this section does not apply to:

      (a) Services upon which the state is prohibited from imposing the surcharge by the Constitution or laws of the United States or the Constitution or laws of the State of Oregon.

      (b) Interconnection between telecommunications utilities, telecommunications cooperatives, competitive telecommunications services providers certified under ORS 759.020, radio common carriers and interexchange carriers.

      (3) The commission annually shall review the surcharge and the balance in the Residential Service Protection Fund established under ORS 759.687 and may make adjustments to the amount of the surcharge to ensure that the fund has adequate resources, provided that the fund balance does not exceed six months of projected expenses.

      (4) Moneys collected pursuant to the surcharge may not be considered in any proceeding to establish rates for telecommunication service.

      (5) The commission shall direct telecommunications public utilities to identify separately in bills to customers for service the surcharge imposed under this section.

      (6) Notwithstanding ORS 314.835 and 314.840, the Department of Revenue may disclose information received under ORS 403.200 to 403.230 to the commission to carry out the provisions of chapter 290, Oregon Laws 1987.

      (7) The commission may disclose information obtained pursuant to chapter 290, Oregon Laws 1987, to the department to administer the tax imposed under ORS 403.200 to 403.230.

      Sec. 2. (1) In carrying out the provisions of section 2, chapter 290, Oregon Laws 1987, the Public Utility Commission shall adopt rules to prohibit the termination of local exchange residential service if the termination would significantly endanger a customer, or a person in the household of the customer, who is:

The customer must attach to the affidavit a copy of an order issued under ORS 30.866, 107.700 to 107.735, 124.005 to 124.040 or 163.738 that restrains another person from contact with the customer, or a person in the household of the customer, or a copy of any other court order that restrains another person from contact with the customer, or a person in the household of the customer, by reason of a risk described in subsection (1) of this section or by reason of stalking.

      (3) The commission shall require that each telecommunications public utility establish procedures for submitting and receiving affidavits under subsection (2) of this section.

      (4) This section does not apply to termination of any telecommunication service other than local exchange residential service.

      (5) A customer submitting an affidavit as provided by subsection (2) of this section is not excused from paying for telecommunication service. Customers are required to enter into a reasonable payment agreement with the telecommunications public utility if an overdue balance exists. Local exchange residential service may be terminated if a customer refuses to enter into or fails to abide by the terms of a reasonable payment agreement.

      (6) Nothing in this section prevents the termination of local exchange residential service if the telecommunications public utility providing the service does not have the technical ability to terminate toll telecommunication service without also terminating local exchange residential service.

      759.694 Legislative recognition of need. It is recognized that a large number of people in this state, through no fault of their own, are unable to utilize telecommunication equipment due to the inability to hear or speak well enough or due to other disabilities. It is also recognized that present technology is available, but at significant cost, that would allow these people to utilize telecommunication equipment in their daily activities. There is, therefore, a need to make available such technology in the form of assistive telecommunication devices and a telecommunications relay service for people who are deaf, hard of hearing or speech impaired or adaptive equipment for people with disabilities at no additional cost beyond normal telephone service. The provision of assistive telecommunication devices and a telecommunications relay service or adaptive equipment would allow those formerly unable to use telecommunication systems to more fully participate in the activities and programs offered by government and other community agencies, as well as in their family and social activities. The assistive telecommunication devices or adaptive equipment would be provided on a loan basis to each recipient, to be returned if the recipient moves out of the state.

      759.698 Eligibility to receive telecommunication devices or adaptive equipment. (1)(a) In order to be eligible to receive assistive telecommunication devices or adaptive equipment, individuals must be certified as deaf, hard of hearing, speech impaired or deaf-blind by a licensed physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, audiologist, hearing aid specialist, speech-language pathologist, rehabilitation instructor for persons who are blind or vocational rehabilitation counselor of the Department of Human Services.
