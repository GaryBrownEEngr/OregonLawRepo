      777.262 Port dredging activities; legislative findings and purpose. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds:

      (a) That recent changes in federal law authorize the United States Army Corps of Engineers to require ports and other local communities to provide a portion of the costs of dredging harbors and channels near those communities;

      (b) That port districts and communities in this state cannot afford to pay the costs necessary to continue the dredging activities that are essential to keep the major harbors and waterways navigable for larger vessels in maritime trade; and

      (c) That the State of Oregon must therefore pay for the dredging activities when ports cannot, or this state must tolerate the loss of maritime trade and commerce that will inevitably result from the halt of dredging activities.

      (2) Therefore, it is the purpose of this section and one purpose of ORS 777.267 to provide a method of financing all or part of the nonfederal portion of the costs of dredging activities that constitute new federally authorized navigation improvements in the ports of this state when those ports are unable to finance the activities.

The bonds shall be secured by the taxing power of the port as provided in ORS 777.430 (2). In addition, the port may provide that the bonds shall be payable from and secured by a lien and pledge of all or any part of the revenues derived by the port from the facilities constructed from the proceeds of the bonds.

      (b) A tax described in this subsection may be levied only as prescribed under ORS 280.040 to 280.145.

      (c) The transfer of moneys raised pursuant to this subsection to a city or county for funding law enforcement services of the city or county within the port is a public purpose for which a port levying a tax under this subsection has been organized. [Amended by 1963 c.9 §38; 1971 c.728 §73; 1991 c.459 §440; 2001 c.500 §1]

      (2) All taxes levied by a port become payable at the same time and shall be collected by the same officers as regular county taxes. The county officers collecting the taxes shall pay them to the treasurer of the port as provided by law. [Amended by 1971 c.728 §74]

 

      777.437 Filing boundary change with county assessor and Department of Revenue. For purposes of ad valorem taxation, a boundary change must be filed in final approved form with the county assessor and the Department of Revenue as provided in ORS 308.225. [2001 c.138 §52]

[Amended by 1971 c.728 §75]

 

      777.445 Procedure subsequent to levy under ORS 777.440. (1) Taxes levied under ORS 777.440 by the county board shall be assessed and collected as if the levy had been made by the port itself.

      (2) However, taxes thus levied by the county board shall not be paid to the treasurer of the port by the county officers collecting the tax, but shall be paid to the county treasurer to the credit of the port issuing the bonds to be used for the purpose provided by subsection (3) of this section.

      (3) The county treasurer shall pay from the fund the interest on or maturing principal of any bond described by ORS 777.440 as it becomes due, and at such places as are designated in the bonds or interest coupons thereof, or upon the presentation at the county treasurer’s office of the bonds or coupons, which must show the amount due and the number and series of the bond.

      (4) All bonds or coupons thereof thus paid shall be immediately reported by the county treasurer to the port board.

      (5) On October 1 of the next calendar year following the year of the levy by the county board, the county treasurer shall ascertain the exact amount of interest and principal payable and still remaining unpaid.

A port may not have more than $10 million in promissory notes outstanding at any one time and may not pledge or use tax-derived revenues to retire the notes. The notes shall be signed by the president and the treasurer of the port and shall state what assets and revenues of the port shall be security for the notes and that the notes do not constitute a full faith and credit pledge of the port. No officer or employee of the port shall hold promissory notes under this section. Expenditure of note proceeds and payment on notes issued under this section shall first be properly budgeted in accordance with the Local Budget Law. [1979 c.119 §2; 1981 c.94 §53; 1993 c.97 §28; 1999 c.177 §1; 2007 c.783 §224; 2019 c.627 §1]

 

      777.450 [Repealed by 1971 c.728 §138]

 

      777.455 Authority to issue refunding bonds for specified purposes; amounts. A port may, in accordance with ORS 777.455 to 777.505, issue refunding bonds for the purpose of refunding and retiring all or any part of its outstanding bonds when the holders are willing to surrender such bonds. When judgment is taken against a port based on bonds and interest coupons issued by the port, refunding bonds may be issued to provide funds with which to pay such judgment. Such bonds may be issued, pursuant to an ordinance or resolution adopted by the board, without elector approval. Such bonds may be issued in the full amount of the outstanding bonds and any judgment on bonds and interest coupons less any sinking funds applicable thereto. The full faith and credit of the issuing port shall be pledged to the payment of the principal of and interest on each of such bonds. Debt limitations imposed by law do not apply to refunding bonds. [Amended by 1971 c.728 §77]

 

      777.460 Refunding bonds; terms and conditions; bond call. (1) The refunding bonds shall bear interest at a rate determined by the board, payable semiannually, and shall be in such denominations and mature at such times as determined by the board, but the bonds must all mature not later than 30 years after their date of issue.

      (2) The board may provide that the bonds are subject to call and redemption prior to maturity, in numerical order, in inverse numerical order or in the entire amount of the issue outstanding. The bonds may be called only on interest-paying dates.

      (3) Before calling bonds containing optional provisions, the port shall publish a notice of call in one issue of a newspaper specializing in financial matters published in New York, New York, at least 30 days before such interest-paying date.

      (4) Callable refunding bonds, at the option of the board, may be called and retired or may be refunded again in accordance with the terms of the bonds and the provisions of ORS 777.455 to 777.505.

      (5) Both the principal of the bonds and the interest thereon, when due, shall be paid in lawful money of the United States at the office of the treasurer of the issuing port, or at the fiscal agency of the State of Oregon in the City and State of New York, at the option of the board. [Amended by 1971 c.728 §78; 1981 c.94 §54]

 

      777.465 Disposition of refunding bonds.

      777.470 Levy of tax to meet principal and interest; amount required; disposition of proceeds of tax. Upon issuance of any refunding bonds the port board shall levy a tax sufficient to pay the principal and interest of such bonds at maturity. If the bonds are serial bonds the tax shall provide an amount of money sufficient to pay the next maturing installment of principal and the interest on the entire issue. If the bonds are issued as term bonds the tax shall be sufficient to raise an amount of money, which, if the same amount were raised each year thereafter for the life of the bonds, would produce a sum equal to the principal amount of the bonds so issued. The proceeds of taxes levied under this section shall be set aside when collected into a special fund and used for no other purpose than the payment of the bonds so issued. [Amended by 1971 c.728 §81]

 

      777.475 Remedies of holders of refunding bonds on default. If there is a default in payment of principal or interest of bonds issued pursuant to ORS 777.455, the holders thereof shall be reinvested with and have all the remedies they would have had if they were holding obligations refunded by the issuance of such bonds. [Amended by 1971 c.728 §82]

 

      777.480 Construction of ORS 777.455 to 777.505. The authority contained in ORS 777.455 to 777.505 is supplemental and in addition to all other powers granted to port districts to issue bonds. [Amended by 1971 c.728 §83]

 

      777.485 Compromise and refunding agreements; contents; subsequent procedure; effect. (1) A board may enter into agreement with the holders of its outstanding indebtedness providing for compromise of the indebtedness and the refunding thereof by the issuance of bonds under ORS 777.455. An agreement may provide for the amount of refunding bonds to be issued, the interest rate the bonds are to bear, the dates of maturity of the bonds and the amount of money to be raised by taxes each year to pay the principal of and interest on the bonds. When an agreement is entered into, a port shall have complete authority to issue bonds in accordance therewith.

      (2) The board may provide in the ordinance authorizing such refunding bonds:

      (a) For setting aside a sinking or other fund into a special trust fund for payment of the bonds.

      (b) For the pledging of taxes and other revenues directly to the payment of the principal of or interest on the bonds or to the sinking fund.

      (c) For limitations on subsequent borrowings by the port either in the nature of permanent debt or temporary financing.

      (d) For limitations on the amounts of appropriations in subsequent budgets for operating expenses.

      (3) A port has all necessary authority to carry out the terms and conditions so included in any such ordinance. The validity of the refunding bonds, however, shall not be dependent upon nor affected by the validity or regularity of the ordinance provisions enumerated in subsection (2) of this section.

(1) Refunding bonds shall be advertised for sale at least once each week for not less than two successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation published within the port or, if there is no such newspaper, then in a newspaper published in the county in which the port is located.

      (2) All bids for such bonds shall be in writing and be sealed and, unless the sale is made to the sinking fund of the particular port or to the State of Oregon, shall be accompanied by a certified check or a cashier’s check upon a bank doing business in this state for an amount of not less than two percent of the par value of the bonds for which the bid is submitted. Bids shall be opened publicly at the time and place specified in the advertisement. The bonds shall be sold for cash.

      (3) If the bids for the purchase of the bonds are not satisfactory, the board may reject any and all of the bids and may readvertise for bids in the manner provided by this section.

      (4) The date of sale shall not precede by more than four months the first succeeding date upon which the bonds to be refunded thereby will mature or may be called, redeemed or otherwise retired. [Amended by 1971 c.728 §79; 1981 c.94 §55]

      (2) Proceeds of sale of the bonds equal to the total par value of the bonds refunded shall be deposited at the fiscal agency mentioned in ORS 777.460 in conformity with the laws relating to deposits of funds with the fiscal agency or, at the option of the issuing port, pursuant to ORS 295.001 to 295.108, in a special trust account to be used solely for the payment of the principal of the outstanding refunding bonds and for no other purpose.

      (3) The outstanding refunded bonds shall be redeemed and retired as soon as possible after the date of sale of the refunding bonds issued in lieu thereof, but in no case shall such refunding bonds be invalidated by reason of the failure of the port to redeem or retire the refunded bonds. [Amended by 1967 c.451 §29; 1971 c.728 §80]

 

      777.510 Port warrants; execution; contents. A port board may issue warrants drawn upon any officer designated the custodian of money belonging to or credited to the port.

Warrants shall show upon their face the nature and extent of the obligation satisfied. They may be used in payment of any obligation of the port, including expenses of operation, payment of the principal amount of port bonds at their maturity and in payment of interest or interest coupons of the bonds at the time the interest becomes due and payable. [Amended by 1971 c.728 §34]

 

      777.515 Payment of warrants; interest on warrants. (1) The treasurer of a port, or the treasurer of the county who is the legal custodian of funds belonging to or credited to a port, shall pay the warrants of the port when presented, if the treasurer has money in custody for the purpose of paying the obligation for which the warrant was given. The treasurer shall write on the face of the warrant the date of redemption and the treasurer’s signature.

      (2) If there are no funds in the custody of the port treasurer to pay the warrant when presented, the port treasurer shall indorse thereon “Not Paid for Want of Funds” and the date of presentment over the signature of the port treasurer. The warrant shall draw interest at the legal rate from the date of such indorsement. Thereafter, the county treasurer, upon presentment of the warrant, shall pay upon the warrant any funds which may come into the county treasurer’s custody for the purpose of paying the obligation for which the warrant was issued and shall, over the signature of the county treasurer, indorse the amount of the payment upon the warrant with the date of the payment.

      (3) However, a warrant drawn in payment of the principal or face amount of a port bond shall in no event draw interest in excess of the rate of interest expressed upon the face of the port bond, and the rate of such interest shall appear upon the face of the warrant. Interest on a warrant shall cease from the date of notice by publication in some newspaper printed or circulated in the county. Notice shall be given by the port treasurer authorized to redeem the warrant, stating that there are funds to redeem outstanding warrants. The treasurer shall give notice when the treasurer has $10,000 belonging to the fund. [Amended by 1971 c.728 §35]

 

      777.520 Special tax levy, rate, use of proceeds; bond sinking fund. (1) A port may assess, levy and collect each year in addition to other taxes which it is by law authorized to levy, a special tax upon all taxable real and personal property situated within the port.

      (2) Such annual levy shall not exceed one-tenth of one percent. The proceeds thereof shall be used only in the purchase on the open market of bonds of the port, at such prices, as the board determines.

      (3) All funds collected from such levy shall be placed in a separate fund, designated the bond sinking fund, and shall be used exclusively for the purposes provided by this section as long as the principal of any bond of the port remains outstanding or unpaid. After the principal of all bonds of the port has been paid, the balance remaining in such fund may be transferred to any other fund as the board may direct. [Amended by 1971 c.728 §85]

 

      777.525 [Repealed by 1971 c.728 §138]

 

      777.530 Special assessments for local improvement; assessment ordinance; assessment districts. (1) When a port constructs or acquires a local improvement which the port is authorized to construct or acquire, the board of that port may levy special assessments against property within the port in proportion to the benefits such property will receive on account of the construction or acquisition of the local improvement. However, before proceeding to construct or acquire a local improvement for which special assessments will be levied, the board shall adopt an ordinance that:

      (a) Describes the local improvement to be constructed or acquired and the part of the work to be undertaken immediately;

      (b) Contains a preliminary estimate of the probable cost of the local improvement;

      (c) Determines the manner of financing the local improvement. The board may provide that the cost of the construction or acquisition shall be paid in part by assessments against the property directly benefited and in part out of general funds, ad valorem tax levies, the proceeds of the sale of bonds, service charges or any combination of such sources. The determination of the board as to the proportion of cost allocation shall be based on its sound discretion;

      (d) Describes one or more assessment districts containing the properties against which the cost of the local improvement will be assessed;

      (e) Provides for the method of assessment, the recording of assessment liens on properties that are directly benefited and for the making of supplemental assessments and rebates;

      (f) Contains provision for a notice to be mailed to each affected property owner announcing the intention of the board to construct or acquire a local improvement, to create one or more assessment districts and to assess benefited property for a part or all of the cost; and

      (g) Provides for a hearing not sooner than 20 days after the mailing of the notices described in paragraph (f) of this subsection at which affected property owners may appear to support or object to the proposed local improvement and assessment. The board shall consider such objections and may adopt, correct, modify or abandon the proposed local improvement or assessments.

      (2) Special assessments in the port shall, so far as practicable, be apportioned within the port in accordance with the special and peculiar benefit each lot or parcel of land receives from the construction or acquisition of a local improvement.

      (3) Special assessment districts authorized by this section may be established for, and limited to, financing the costs of planning and engineering required for the construction or acquisition of a local improvement.

      (4) As used in this section, “local improvement” has the meaning given that term by ORS 223.001. [1989 c.644 §2; 1991 c.902 §117]

 

      Note: 777.530 and 777.535 were added to and made a part of ORS chapter 777 by legislative action but were not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      777.535 Installment payment of special assessment; limitation. The provisions of ORS 223.205 to 223.314 (Bancroft Bonding Act) and ORS 223.770 relating to the assessment of property benefited by public improvements and to the issuance of bonds and other obligations for the cost of such improvements, shall apply insofar as practicable and applicable in relation to the assessment by ports of the cost or any portion of the cost of improvements against the property benefited in accordance with ORS 777.530 and to the issuance of bonds and other obligations by the port. However, notwithstanding ORS 223.295, the limitation specified in ORS 777.410 (1)(a) on the amount of general obligation bonds outstanding at any one time applies to bonds and other obligations issued under this section. [1989 c.644 §3; 1991 c.902 §116; 1995 c.333 §21; 1997 c.249 §223]

 

      Note: See note under 777.530.

 

      777.560 Ports may issue and sell revenue bonds; use of proceeds. (1) For the purpose of carrying into effect any of the powers granted to ports, a port may issue and sell revenue bonds in accordance with ORS 777.560 to 777.590 without the necessity of obtaining the prior approval of the electors of the port. Proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds may be used by the port in its governmental capacity or loaned to private parties. The proceeds may be used to cover the costs incurred in issuing the bonds, and preliminary work incident to carrying out such purposes and powers, including but not limited to planning, engineering, inspection, accounting, fiscal, legal and trustee expenses, the cost of issuance of bonds, engraving, printing, advertising and other similar expenses, and to pay interest on the outstanding bonds issued for any project during the period of actual construction and for six months after the completion thereof. Revenue bonds shall not be a general obligation of the port nor a charge upon the tax revenues of the port, nor a charge upon any other revenues or property of the port not specifically pledged thereto.

      (2) In addition to the powers granted by subsection (1) of this section, a port may authorize and issue revenue bonds under ORS 287A.150. [1955 c.423 §2; 1959 c.337 §1; 1971 c.728 §86; 1993 c.97 §29; 2007 c.783 §225]

 

      777.565 Resolution or ordinance authorizing revenue bonds and creating special trust fund. (1) Revenue bonds issued under ORS 777.560 (1) shall be authorized by resolution or ordinance of the board. The resolution or ordinance shall provide for the creation of a special trust fund, authorize the appointment of a trustee to administer the fund, and obligate the port to set aside and pay into the special trust fund all, or a portion, of its nontax-derived revenues not otherwise pledged or committed for other purposes for any activity authorized by ORS 777.105 to 777.258, other than an activity under ORS 777.250 (4)(a) or (c). For a facility or facilities designated under ORS 777.250 (4)(a) or (c), no revenues other than those derived from the particular facility or facilities to be financed by the sale of the particular issue of revenue bonds then being authorized shall be pledged. The board may, in addition, pledge for the payment of the principal and interest of any issue of such bonds any property of the port not pledged for other purposes. However, with respect to revenue bonds issued to finance a facility or facilities designated under ORS 777.250 (4)(a) or (c), the board, in addition, may only pledge or mortgage such facilities including buildings, improvements or properties, and any land acquired in connection with such facilities, for the benefit of the holders of revenue bonds issued therefor. Notice that action upon the bond resolution or ordinance will be taken at the designated meeting of the board shall be given for a period of not less than two consecutive weeks, prior to the meeting, by publication once each week in a newspaper of general circulation, published within the port or, if there be no such newspaper, in a newspaper of general circulation, published within the county.

      (2) A special trust fund created by a resolution or ordinance adopted under subsection (1) of this section shall be used solely for payment of principal and interest due upon the revenue bonds issued and sold pursuant to ORS 777.560 (1), and to the payment of the costs and expenses enumerated in ORS 777.560.

      (3) The resolution or ordinance may provide that if the money in the special trust fund is insufficient to pay the revenue bonds the bonds shall be payable out of any part or all of other nontax-derived revenues of the port. However, for a facility or facilities designated under ORS 777.250 (4)(a) or (c), no revenues other than those derived from the particular facility or facilities to be financed by the sale of the particular issue of revenue bonds then being authorized shall be pledged. When all bonds issued and sold pursuant to ORS 777.560 (1) and expenses thereof have been paid so that no charge remains upon the special fund, the board may, by resolution or ordinance, transfer any balance remaining in the fund to its general fund, discharge the trustee and dissolve the special fund. The trustee authorized to administer the fund may, subject to approval of the board, invest and reinvest moneys in the special fund in securities in which the State of Oregon may by law invest.

      (4) ORS 777.560 to 777.590 and the provisions of the resolution or ordinance authorizing a revenue bond issue constitute a contract with the holders of the bonds, and shall be enforceable by any owner or holder of the bonds. [1955 c.423 §3; 1959 c.337 §2; 1965 c.223 §3; 1967 c.621 §1; 1971 c.728 §87; 1979 c.407 §2; 1997 c.171 §23; 2007 c.783 §226]

      (1) Shall be negotiable instruments.

      (2) Shall be issued under ORS chapter 287A, but the requirements of ORS 287A.150 do not apply.

      (3) Shall contain a recital that principal and interest on the revenue bonds are payable solely out of revenues and property of the port pledged to the payment thereof by the ordinance of the board authorizing the issue of which the bonds are a part.

      (4) May contain covenants of the port to protect and safeguard the security and rights of holders of such bonds and such other terms and conditions, in conformity with ORS 777.560 to 777.590, which the board determines are necessary or desirable to protect the port or increase the marketability of the bonds. [1955 c.423 §4; 1959 c.337 §3; 1965 c.223 §4; 1971 c.728 §141; 1971 c.778 §1; 1981 c.879 §3; 1997 c.171 §24; 2007 c.783 §227]

 

      777.575 Sale of bonds. (1) The board may from time to time sell revenue bonds authorized pursuant to ORS 777.565, as provided by this section.

      (2) Except as provided by subsections (3) and (4) of this section, the bonds shall be advertised for sale at least once each week for not less than two successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation published within the port or, if there is no such newspaper, then in a newspaper published in the county. Bids shall be in writing and be sealed and, unless the bidder is the State of Oregon, accompanied by a certified check or a cashier’s check upon a bank doing business in this state in an amount not less than two percent of the par value of the bonds. Bids shall be opened publicly at the time and place specified in the advertisement. If the bids are not satisfactory, the board may reject any and all bids and may readvertise for bids in the manner provided by this subsection.

      (3) The board may sell any of the bonds to the federal government or any agency thereof at private sale without advertisement or calling for bids.

      (4) Revenue bonds including revenue bonds to refund such bonds of a port may be sold to any person either at a public or private sale without advertisement or calling for bids as the board may in its sole discretion determine. [1955 c.423 §5; 1959 c.337 §4; 1965 c.223 §5; 1967 c.416 §1; 1971 c.728 §89; 1981 c.94 §56]

      777.585 Refunding revenue bonds. (1) A port may, without the necessity of authorization from the electors of the port, issue and sell its refunding revenue bonds for the purpose of redeeming revenue bonds which are outstanding or paying interest due thereon:

      (a) At maturity pursuant to redemption provisions in the outstanding revenue bonds; or

      (b) At any time before maturity if the holders of the outstanding revenue bonds consent or if the outstanding revenue bonds authorize redemption before maturity.

      (2) ORS 777.560 to 777.590 apply to bonds authorized to be issued and sold under this section. [1955 c.423 §7; 1959 c.337 §6; 1965 c.223 §7; 1971 c.728 §90]

 

      777.590 Authority to issue and sell revenue bonds; leasing property and pledging revenues. (1) ORS 777.560 to 777.590 are complete authority for the issuance and sale of revenue bonds and refunding revenue bonds. Any restrictions, limitations, conditions or procedure provided by other statutes relating to issuance and sale of bonds or other obligations do not apply to the issuance and sale of revenue bonds and refunding revenue bonds under ORS 777.560 to 777.590.

      (2) The lease of any property of the port and the pledging of revenues therefrom to the payment of the costs and expenses enumerated by ORS 777.560, and to the payment of principal and interest on bonds issued and sold under ORS 777.560 to 777.590, shall be considered to further the public interest within the meaning of ORS 271.310. [1955 c.423 §8; 1959 c.337 §7; 1965 c.223 §8; 1971 c.728 §91; 2005 c.443 §27]

EXPORT TRADING CORPORATIONS

 

      777.755 Legislative findings and policy. The Legislative Assembly hereby finds that:

      (1) The geographical location of this state, its maritime resources, its skilled labor force and the availability of land for industrial and commercial development provide an opportunity for the citizens of this state to expand participation in and increase the benefits from international trade and commerce.

      (2) The development and operation of international trade and commerce is in the public interest because that trade and commerce promotes the commerce of this state, creates and retains jobs and diversifies the economy of this state.

      (3) Export trading corporations, encouraged by federal law, provide a means to develop and facilitate international trade and commerce and the export and import of goods and services through this state by furnishing services necessary to international trade and by the purchase, sale and financing of goods and services.
