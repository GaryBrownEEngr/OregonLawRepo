Notice that action upon the bond ordinance will be taken at the designated meeting of the board, shall be given for a period of not less than two consecutive weeks, prior to such meeting, by publication thereof once each week in a newspaper of general circulation, published within the corporate boundaries of the port or, if there be no such newspaper, by posting such notice for a period of not less than two weeks in three public places in the port.

      (2) The money in any special trust fund created by an ordinance authorizing an issue of revenue bonds shall be used solely for the purposes provided therefor by the ordinance.

      (3) The ordinance may obligate the port, and the port shall have power to fix, levy and collect such rates, rentals, fees and other charges for the use and services of all or any of its facilities, which revenues may be pledged to the payment of the principal of and interest on and premium, if any, of the revenue bonds or any of them and if so pledged shall be sufficient to produce revenues, along with other lawfully available funds, adequate to pay the costs of the operation, maintenance and repair of any or all port properties; to pay or provide for the payment of the principal of and interest on, and premium, if any, of such revenue bonds or any of them, including any reserves for such payment; and to produce such additional amount of revenues therefrom as the port may covenant with the holders of such revenue bonds.

      (4) The ordinance may provide that in the event the money in a special trust fund is insufficient to pay the revenue bonds to be paid out of the fund, such revenue bonds shall be payable out of any part or all of other nonpledged revenues of the port. Whenever all bonds and expenses thereof have been paid so that no charge remains upon such special fund, the board may, by ordinance, transfer any balance remaining in such fund to its general fund, discharge the trustee, if any, and dissolve the special fund. Any trustee authorized to administer the fund, may, subject to approval of the board, invest and reinvest moneys in the special fund in any security or securities in which the State of Oregon may by law invest.

      (5) If the board fails to set aside and pay revenues into a special trust fund as required by the ordinance authorizing the issuance and sale of the bonds secured by the fund, a holder of any of such bonds may bring suit against the port to compel compliance with the provisions of the ordinance in the circuit court of the county in which the port has its principal office.

      (4) May contain covenants of the port to protect and safeguard the security and rights of holders of any such bonds and such other terms and conditions, in conformity with ORS 778.145 to 778.175, which the board in its discretion determines are necessary or desirable to protect the port or increase the marketability of the bonds.

      (2) Bond anticipation notes shall be issued for all moneys so borrowed under the provisions of this section. Such notes may be issued for a period not exceeding one year and may be renewed from time to time for periods of not exceeding one year, but each such note, including renewals, shall mature and be paid not later than the fifth anniversary of the date the original note was issued. Such notes shall be authorized by ordinance of the board and shall be in such denomination or denominations, shall bear interest at such rate or rates approved by the board, shall be in such form and shall be executed in such manner, all as the board shall prescribe. Such notes may be sold at public or private sale in the manner and at such price or prices as the board shall determine, provided that if such notes be renewal notes, they may be exchanged for notes then outstanding on such terms as the board shall determine.
