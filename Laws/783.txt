      (1) For wages due to persons employed, for work done or services rendered on board such boat or vessel.

      (2) For all debts due to persons by virtue of a contract, expressed or implied, with the owners of a boat or vessel, or with the agents, contractors or subcontractors of such owner, or with any person having them employed to construct, repair or launch such boat or vessel, on account of:

      (a) Labor done or materials furnished by mechanics, tradesmen or others in the building, repairing, fitting and furnishing or equipping of such boat or vessel;

      (b) Stores and supplies furnished for the use thereof;

      (c) Premiums for insurance placed on or with respect to such boat or vessel; or

      (d) Launchways constructed for the launching of such boat or vessel.

      (3) For all sums for wharfage, anchorage or towage of such boat or vessel within this state.

      (4) For all demands or damages accruing from the nonperformance or malperformance of any contract of affreightment, or of any contract touching the transportation of persons or property, entered into by the master, owner, agent or consignee of the boat or vessel on which such contract is to be performed, and for damages or injuries done to persons or property, by such boat or vessel, and for damages or injuries by such boat or vessel resulting in the death of any person. [Amended by 1981 c.548 §1; 2005 c.22 §511]

 

      783.020 Lien priority. (1) The classes of claims specified in ORS 783.010 shall have priority according to the order in which they are enumerated.

      (2) The liens under ORS 783.010 shall have precedence over all other liens and claims against such boat or vessel, except the following liens, claims and security interests, whether or not the following liens, claims or security interests have arisen or been perfected before or after liens under ORS 783.010:

      (a) Liens and claims arising under those portions of the Ship Mortgage Act, 1920, that appear in sections 921 to 954 and 971 to 975 of title 46 of the United States Code.

      (b) Security interests perfected under ORS chapter 79.

      783.030 Right to proceed against boat or vessel directly. Any person having a demand as mentioned in ORS 783.010, instead of proceeding for recovery thereof against the master, owner, agent or consignee of the boat or vessel, may at the person’s option commence an action against such boat or vessel by name.

 

      783.040 Complaint; jurisdiction and venue. Any person wishing to commence an action against a boat or vessel shall file the complaint against such boat or vessel by name with the clerk of the circuit court of the county in which the boat or vessel may lie or be. The complaint shall set forth the plaintiff’s demand in all its particulars, and on whose account the same accrued, and shall be verified by the plaintiff or some credible person for the plaintiff.

 

      783.050 Issuance of warrant for seizure of boat or vessel. Whenever the complaint is filed, the clerk shall issue a warrant thereon, commanding the sheriff to seize the boat or vessel mentioned in the complaint, with the tackle, apparel and furniture of the boat or vessel and retain the same until discharged from such custody by due course of law.

 

      783.060 Procedure after return of warrant. Upon the return of any warrant issued as prescribed in ORS 783.050, proceeding shall be had in the circuit court against the boat or vessel seized, in the same manner as if the action had been commenced against the person on whose account the demand accrued.

 

      783.070 Persons authorized to appear for boat or vessel; answer. The master, owner, agent or consignee of the boat or vessel may appear on behalf of the boat or vessel and answer the complaint.

 

      783.080 Judgment by default; proceedings on issue of fact. If in any action commenced under ORS 783.030 and 783.040 the master, owner, agent or consignee does not appear and answer the complaint, the plaintiff may proceed to take judgment in the same manner and under the same restrictions as in a civil action against a natural person. If an issue of fact is joined, the same proceeding shall be had as in other actions.

 

      783.090 Discharge of boat or vessel on giving of undertaking. If the master, owner, agent or consignee, before final judgment in any action commenced in pursuance of ORS 783.030 and 783.040, enters into an undertaking in favor of the plaintiff, with sufficient security, to be approved by the judge or clerk of the court in which the action is pending, conditioned to satisfy the amount which is adjudged due and owing to the plaintiff on determination of the action, together with all costs accruing, such boat or vessel, with its tackle, apparel and furniture, shall be discharged from further detention by the sheriff.

 

      783.100 Return of deposit; disposition of balance. If judgment is for the defendant, any deposit in lieu of an undertaking shall be returned to the person making the same; or if a balance remains after satisfying any judgment in favor of the plaintiff and costs of suit, the balance shall be so returned.

 

      783.110 Order for sale on judgment. If judgment is rendered against any boat or vessel in favor of the plaintiff, the court shall make an order directed to the sheriff, commanding the sheriff to sell the boat or vessel, together with its tackle, apparel and furniture, to satisfy the judgment and costs which may have accrued in the cause, which order shall be executed and returned in the same manner as other executions.

 

      783.120 Judgment on undertaking; issuance of execution. If an undertaking with surety was given according to ORS 783.090 and judgment rendered in favor of the plaintiff, a judgment shall also be rendered upon the undertaking, and execution issued for the amount of judgment and costs in favor of the plaintiff, against the principal and security in such undertaking.

 

      783.130 Bill of sale of boat or vessel; effect of previous liens. When any boat or vessel is sold in pursuance of ORS 783.110 to 783.160, the officer making the sale shall execute to the purchaser a bill of sale therefor, and such boat or vessel shall, in the hands of the purchaser and the purchaser’s assigns, be free and discharged from all previous liens and claims under this title.

 

      783.140 Rights of other lien claimants. Any other person having or claiming a lien against any boat or vessel in pursuance of ORS 783.010 may, at any time after the sale upon execution and before payment over of any surplus in the hands of the sheriff, commence an action against such boat by name, as if the same had not been sold, and serve notice thereof upon the former master, owner, agent or consignee. While such action is pending, the sheriff shall not pay over any surplus that may be in the sheriff’s hands to such master, owner, agent or consignee.

 

      783.150 Distribution of proceeds of sale. In the distribution of the proceeds of sale, claims of a prior class shall be paid entire before any payment shall be made upon claims of a subsequent class. When the money to be applied to any class is insufficient to pay all the claims of that class, it shall be apportioned ratably among the claims of that class.

 

      783.160 Sale of appurtenances for fractional share of boat or vessel. If it appears to the court in which the action is pending, or the judge thereof, that the liens against the boat or vessel can be satisfied by a sale of the tackle, apparel and furniture, or a part thereof, or a fractional share in such boat or vessel, the court or judge may modify the order of sale accordingly. If in pursuance of such order a sale is made of a fractional share in such boat or vessel, the purchaser shall hold such share jointly with the other owners.

 

      783.170 Limitation of actions. All actions against a boat or vessel under ORS 783.010 to 783.160 shall be commenced within one year after the cause of action has accrued.

 

NAVIGATIONAL WRONGS AND REMEDIES

 

      783.310 Destruction or injury of property by watercraft; liability of tortfeasor and employer; lien on vessel. If any person in control of any watercraft conducts or navigates the watercraft intentionally or negligently so as to destroy or injure the property of another, the person and the person’s employer each shall be liable in damages for the property so injured or destroyed, and the damages shall be a lien on the watercraft. [Amended by 2005 c.22 §512]

 

      783.320 Injuries to persons or property ashore; liability in damages; venue. The owner or owners of any boat or vessel which, when navigating the waters of this state or when within the waters of this state, has, through the negligence or misconduct of the owner, agent, master, pilot or employees thereon, caused injury to persons or property upon shore or upon wharves, warehouses, bridges or other structures affixed or contiguous to such shore, wharves, warehouses, bridges or other structures, shall be liable for all damages resulting to such person or to the owners of such property by reason thereof. The persons so injured may recover the same in an action at law in the circuit court of any county within which the boat or vessel may be found.

 

      783.330 Attachment against vessel; motion and undertaking. The person so injured may at the time of filing the complaint, or at any time subsequent thereto, cause an attachment to issue against the vessel. The clerk of the circuit court shall issue a writ of attachment directing the sheriff of the county to levy upon, seize and take the vessel; but such attachment shall only issue upon the filing by the plaintiff of a written motion for such attachment, together with an undertaking in a sum equal in amount to the sum demanded in the complaint. The undertaking shall be executed by one or more sureties, and shall be so conditioned that the signers thereof shall be liable in the sum named therein to the owners of the vessel if the attachment is wrongful or without sufficient cause. The sureties shall in the aggregate justify in double the amount of the undertaking.

 

      783.340 Redelivery of attached vessel. The sheriff shall redeliver the vessel attached to the owner or master thereof upon the owner or master delivering to the sheriff an undertaking, with one or more sufficient sureties approved by the judge of the court, or in case of the judge’s absence by the sheriff, which undertaking shall be so conditioned that the obligors therein shall pay to the plaintiff the judgment rendered in the cause. The sureties thereon shall in the aggregate justify in double the amount of the undertaking.

 

      783.350 Nonresident owners; service; judgment; designation. If the owner of the vessel is nonresident of and not within Oregon, service of the summons and complaint shall be made upon the master or person in charge of the vessel, with the same force and effect as though made by publication. In such event the owner shall be required to appear and answer to the complaint within the same time as though the owner were served personally. In such event no personal judgment against the owner shall be rendered in the action, but only an order of sale of the property attached, or, in event of such property being released upon undertaking, then judgment shall be rendered against the obligors thereon. In the event of the vessel belonging to nonresidents, defects in the names of parties defendant shall not in any respect affect the validity of the proceedings or of any judgment rendered therein.

 

      783.360 Priority of attachment. The attachment provided for in ORS 783.330 shall have priority over any mortgage upon the vessel and over any liens thereon not of a maritime nature.
