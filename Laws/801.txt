      (3) The provisions described in this subsection shall be applicable and uniform throughout this state and in all political subdivisions and municipalities therein and on the ocean shore which has been or may hereafter be declared a state recreation area.

      (4) The provisions of the vehicle code applicable to drivers of vehicles upon the highways shall apply to the drivers of all vehicles owned or operated by the United States, this state or any county, city, district or any other political subdivision of this state, subject to such specific exceptions as are set forth in the vehicle code.

      (5) Except as provided otherwise by federal law, the provisions of the vehicle code shall be applicable and uniform on federal lands within this state.

      (6) Except as provided otherwise by federal law, traffic rules and regulations which are promulgated by a federal authority having jurisdiction over federal lands within this state and which vary from the provisions of the vehicle code shall be the law of the local authority within whose boundaries the federal land is located, and enforceable as such, if:

      (a) Local authorities are authorized to vary in the same manner under the provisions of the vehicle code; and

      (b) Prior approval for the variance has been obtained by the federal authority from the governing body of the local authority within whose boundaries the federal land is located.

      (7) The vehicle code shall govern the construction of and punishment for any vehicle code offense committed after June 27, 1975, the construction and application of any defense to a prosecution for such an offense and any administrative proceedings authorized or affected by the vehicle code.

      (8) When all or part of a vehicle code statute is amended or repealed, the statute or part thereof so amended or repealed remains in force for the purpose of authorizing the accusation, prosecution, conviction and punishment of a person who violated the statute or part thereof before the effective date of the amending or repealing Act.

      (9) The provisions of the vehicle code described in this subsection relating to the operation of vehicles refer exclusively to operation of vehicles upon highways and the ocean shore which has been or may hereafter be declared to be a state recreation area, except where the vehicle code specifically provides otherwise. This subsection applies to the provisions of the vehicle code relating to abandoned vehicles, vehicle equipment, regulation of vehicle size, weight and load, the manner of operation of vehicles and use of roads by persons, animals and vehicles.

      (12) If any of the provisions under ORS 818.200 relating to variance permits are found to contravene section 127 of title 23, United States Code, it shall not serve to render inoperative any remaining of such provisions that may be held not to conflict with that federal law. [1983 c.338 §4; 1985 c.16 §4; 2003 c.655 §84b; 2005 c.654 §36]

The following limits are partial or complete as described:

      (1) No county, municipal or other local body with authority to adopt and administer local police regulations under the Constitution and laws of this state shall enact or enforce any rule or regulation in conflict with the provisions of the vehicle code described in this subsection except as specifically authorized in the vehicle code. This subsection applies to the provisions of the vehicle code relating to abandoned vehicles, vehicle equipment, regulation of vehicle size, weight and load, the manner of operation of vehicles and use of roads by persons, animals and vehicles.

      (2) Except as provided in ORS 822.230 and this subsection, no city, county or other political subdivisions shall regulate or require or issue any registration, licenses, permits or surety bonds or charge any fee for the regulatory or surety registration of any person required to obtain a certificate from the Department of Transportation under ORS 822.205. This subsection does not:

      (a) Limit any authority of a city or county to license and collect a general and nondiscriminatory license fee levied upon all businesses or to levy a tax based upon business conducted by any person within the city or county.

      (b) Limit the authority of any city or county to impose any requirements or conditions as part of any contract to perform towing or recovering services for the city or county.

      (c) Limit the authority of any city or county to impose requirements and conditions that govern the towing of a vehicle by a towing business under ORS 98.812 so long as those requirements and conditions are consistent with the provisions of ORS 822.230.

      (3) No city, county or other political subdivision of this state, nor any state agency, may adopt a regulation or ordinance that imposes a special fee for the use of public lands or waters by snowmobiles or Class I all-terrain vehicles, or for the use of any access thereto that is owned by or under the jurisdiction of either the United States, this state or any such city, county or other political subdivision. The registration fees provided by ORS 821.320 are in lieu of any personal property or excise tax imposed on snowmobiles by this state or any political subdivision. No city, county or other municipality, and no state agency shall impose any other registration or license fee on any snowmobile in this state. This subsection does not prohibit any city, county or other political subdivision, or any state agency from regulating the operation of snowmobiles or Class I all-terrain vehicles on public lands, waters and other properties under its jurisdiction and on streets or highways within its boundaries by adopting regulations or ordinances of its governing body if such regulations are not inconsistent with ORS 821.150 to 821.292.

      (4) The provisions of ORS 819.110 to 819.215 relating to towing of vehicles that are abandoned establish minimum requirements subject to the following:

      (a) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this subsection, a county or incorporated city may supersede such provisions by ordinance or charter provision.
