______________________________________________________________________________

ARTICLE I

FINDINGS AND DECLARATION

OF POLICY

      (a) The party states find that:

      (1) The safety of their streets and highways is materially affected by the degree of compliance with state laws and local ordinances relating to the operation of motor vehicles.

      (2) Violation of such a law or ordinance is evidence that the violator engages in conduct which is likely to endanger the safety of persons and property.

      (3) The continuance in force of a license to drive is predicated upon compliance with laws and ordinances relating to the operation of motor vehicles, in whichever jurisdiction the vehicle is operated.

      (b) It is the policy of each of the party states to:

      (1) Promote compliance with the laws, ordinances, and administrative rules and regulations relating to the operation of motor vehicles by their operators in each of the jurisdictions where such operators drive motor vehicles.

      (2) Make the reciprocal recognition of licenses to drive and eligibility therefor more just and equitable by considering the overall compliance with motor vehicle laws, ordinances and administrative rules and regulations as a condition precedent to the continuance or issuance of any license by reason of which the licensee is authorized or permitted to operate a motor vehicle in any of the party states.

ARTICLE II

DEFINITIONS

      As used in this compact:

      (a) “State” means a state, territory or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

      (b) “Home state” means the state which has issued and has the power to suspend or revoke the use of the license or permit to operate a motor vehicle.

      (c) “Conviction” means a conviction of any offense related to the use or operation of a motor vehicle which is prohibited by state law, municipal ordinance or administrative rule or regulation, or a forfeiture of bail, bond or other security deposited to secure appearance by a person charged with having committed any such offense, and which conviction or forfeiture is required to be reported to the licensing authority.

ARTICLE III

REPORTS OF CONVICTION

      The licensing authority of a party state shall report each conviction of a person from another party state occurring within its jurisdiction to the licensing authority of the home state of the licensee. Such report shall clearly identify the person convicted; describe the violation specifying the section of the statute, code or ordinance violated; identify the court in which action was taken; indicate whether a plea of guilty or not guilty was entered, or the conviction was a result of the forfeiture of bail, bond or other security; and shall include any special findings made in connection therewith.

ARTICLE IV

EFFECT OF CONVICTION

      (a) The licensing authority in the home state, for the purposes of suspension, revocation or limitation of the license to operate a motor vehicle, shall give the same effect to the conduct reported, pursuant to Article III of this compact, as it would if such conduct had occurred in the home state, in the case of convictions for:

      (1) Manslaughter or negligent homicide resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle;

      (2) Driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a narcotic drug or a controlled substance, or under the influence of any other drug or substance to a degree which renders the driver incapable of safely driving a motor vehicle;

      (3) Any felony in the commission of which a motor vehicle is used;

      (4) Failure to stop and render aid in the event of a motor vehicle accident resulting in the death or personal injury of another.

      (b) As to other convictions, reported pursuant to Article III, the licensing authority in the home state shall give such effect to the conduct as is provided by the laws of the home state.

      (c) If the laws of a party state do not provide for offenses or violations denominated or described in precisely the words employed in subdivision (a) of this Article, such party state shall construe the denominations and descriptions appearing in subdivision (a) hereof as being applicable to and identifying those offenses or violations of a substantially similar nature and the laws of such party state shall contain such provisions as may be necessary to insure that full force and effect is given to this Article.

ARTICLE V

APPLICATIONS FOR NEW LICENSES

      Upon application for a license to drive, the licensing authority in a party state shall ascertain whether the applicant has ever held, or is the holder of a license to drive issued by any other party state. The licensing authority in the state where application is made shall not issue a license to drive to the applicant if:

      (1) The applicant has held such a license, but the same has been suspended by reason, in whole or in part, of a violation and if such suspension period has not terminated.

      (2) The applicant has held such a license, but the same has been revoked by reason, in whole or in part, of a violation and if such revocation has not terminated, except that after the expiration of one year from the date the license was revoked, such person may make application for a new license if permitted by law. The licensing authority may refuse to issue a license to any such applicant if, after investigation, the licensing authority determines that it will not be safe to grant to such person the privilege of driving a motor vehicle on the public highways.

      (3) The applicant is the holder of a license to drive issued by another party state and currently in force unless the applicant surrenders such license.

ARTICLE VI

APPLICABILITY OF OTHER LAWS

No withdrawal shall affect the validity or applicability by the licensing authorities of states remaining party to the compact of any report of conviction occurring prior to the withdrawal.

ARTICLE IX

CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY

      (a) It is the objective of the participating jurisdictions to obtain more efficient and more economical transportation by motor vehicles between and among the participating jurisdictions by encouraging the adoption of standards that will, as minimums, allow the operation on all State highways, except those determined through engineering evaluation to be inadequate, with a single-axle weight of 20,000 pounds, a tandem-axle weight of 34,000 pounds, and a gross vehicle or combination weight of that resulting from application of the formula:

 

W =                 500 ((LN/N - 1) + 12N + 36)

where W =      maximum weight in pounds

                        carried on any group of two or more

                        axles computed to nearest 500 pounds.

L =                   distance in feet between

                        the extremes of any group of two

                        or more consecutive axles.

N =                  number of axles in group

                        under consideration.

 

      (b) It is the further objective of the participating jurisdictions that the operation in interstate commerce of a vehicle or combination of vehicles that exceeds statutory maximum weights or statutory maximum lengths be authorized under special permit authority by each participating jurisdiction.

      (c) It is the further objective of the participating jurisdictions to facilitate and expedite the operation of any vehicle or combination of vehicles between and among the participating jurisdictions under the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, and to that end the participating jurisdictions hereby agree, through their designated representatives, to meet and cooperate in the consideration of vehicle size and weight related matters including, but not limited to, the development of: uniform enforcement procedures; additional vehicle size and weight standards; operational standards; agreements or compacts to facilitate regional application and administration of vehicle size and weight standards; uniform permit procedures; uniform application forms; rules and regulations for the operation of vehicles, including equipment requirements, driver qualifications, and operating practices; and such other matters as may be pertinent.

      (d) It is the further objective of the participating jurisdictions to authorize the cooperating committee to recommend that the participating jurisdictions jointly secure congressional approval of this agreement and, specifically, of the vehicle size and weight standards set forth in subsection (a) of this section.

      (e) It is the further objective of the participating jurisdictions to:

      (1) Establish transportation laws and regulations to meet regional economic needs and to promote an efficient, safe and consistent transportation network;

      (2) Develop standards that facilitate the most efficient and environmentally sound operation of vehicles on highways consistent with and in recognition of principles of highway safety; and
