      (1) The original certificate of title issued by the Department of Transportation;

      (2) A salvage title certificate issued by the department; or

      803.012 Rules for title forms and fees. (1) The Department of Transportation may adopt rules authorizing different forms of title and specifying the uses of the different forms. The rules may include, but need not be limited to, rules authorizing and describing uses of electronic titles and certificates of title.

      (2) Rules adopted under this section may require or allow different forms of title for different purposes or for different persons.

      (3) Rules adopted under this section may include fee structures that vary for different forms of title but in no case may the department charge more than the fees established for similar title transactions under ORS 803.090. [1993 c.233 §6]

 

      803.015 Certificate contents. The Department of Transportation shall design a certificate of title for vehicles for situations in which the department determines that certificates will be issued. A certificate of title issued by the department shall conform to all of the following:

      (7) The certificate shall be authenticated by a seal of the State of Oregon printed on the certificate.

      (10) The certificate shall show the mileage of the vehicle as reported to the department at the time the most recent title transfer was reported to the department, or the mileage reported to the department at the time the vehicle was initially titled in Oregon, whichever occurred last. The information required by this subsection shall be shown as reported to the department on odometer disclosure reports required by law to be submitted to the department.

      (11) The certificate shall contain any brand or notation specified by the department by rule.

      (12) The certificate shall contain any other information required by the department.

      (13) The certificate shall be produced by a secure process that meets or exceeds the requirements of federal law.

      (f) Unless the department adopts rules to the contrary, if the vehicle is from another jurisdiction, the applicant shall surrender to the department with the application the certificate of title issued by the other jurisdiction, if such jurisdiction requires certificates of title. If such jurisdiction does not require certificates of title, then the applicant shall surrender the registration cards.

(Transfer of Title or Interest)

 

      803.092 Application for title upon transfer of interest; when and by whom required; exceptions. (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, upon the transfer of any interest in a vehicle covered by an Oregon title the transferee shall submit an application for title to the Department of Transportation. Such application shall be submitted to the department within 30 days of the date of transfer of interest.

      (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, application is not required under this section when:

      (a) The change involves only a change in the security interest where the security interest holder or lessor is a financial institution, a financial holding company or a bank holding company, as those terms are defined in ORS 706.008, a licensee under ORS chapter 725, or any subsidiary or affiliate of any of the foregoing and the transfer of the interest of the security interest holder or lessor:

      (A) Results from the merger, conversion, reorganization, consolidation or acquisition of the security interest holder or lessor;

      (B) Is to an entity that is a member of the same affiliated group as the security holder or lessor; or

      (C) Is made in connection with a transfer in bulk.

      (b) The vehicle is transferred to a vehicle dealer and the vehicle will become part of the dealer’s inventory for resale. Upon the transfer of a vehicle to a dealer, however, the dealer shall immediately notify the department of such transfer. This exemption from the requirement to apply for title does not apply if the department determines that application for title is necessary in order to comply with odometer disclosure requirements. If the department determines that application for title is not required, it may require filing of documents under ORS 803.126.

      (c) The vehicle is to be titled in another jurisdiction.

      (d) The vehicle has been totaled, wrecked, dismantled, disassembled, substantially altered or destroyed, in which case the provisions of ORS 819.010, 819.012, 819.014 or 822.135 relating to notice and surrender of title documents shall be complied with.

      (e) The transfer involves the creation or termination of a leasehold interest in a vehicle that is proportionally registered under ORS 826.009 or 826.011, if the department is furnished with satisfactory proof of the lease.

      (3) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the transferee shall:

      (a) Submit an application that meets requirements for title under ORS 803.045 and 803.050 and any applicable rules of the department.

      (b) Submit the title transfer fees as required under ORS 803.090.

      (c) Comply with the provisions of ORS 803.065 and any applicable rules of the department under that statute and submit the duplicate or replacement title fee as provided under ORS 803.090, if the transfer includes an application for duplicate or replacement title and transfer of title.

      (d) Submit an odometer disclosure containing information required by the department for the kind of transaction involved.

      (e) Submit any late presentation of certificate of title fee as provided under ORS 803.090 if such fee is required under ORS 803.105.

      (4) For purposes of this section:

      (a) “Affiliated group” has the meaning given to the term in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (26 U.S.C. 1504(a)).

      (b) A “transfer in bulk” is:

      (A) The sale or assignment of, the grant of a security interest in, or any other transfer of either a group of loans secured by vehicles, leases of vehicles or both or a participation or other interest in the group of loans;

      (B) The creation of asset-backed securities or other securing of assets involving the loans or leases; or

      (C) Any similar transaction involving the loans or leases. [1989 c.148 §3; 1989 c.452 §7; 1991 c.67 §212; 1991 c.820 §14; 1991 c.873 §12; 1993 c.233 §29; 1993 c.427 §1; 1997 c.631 §554; 2001 c.377 §53; 2001 c.675 §9; 2003 c.655 §102]

 

      803.094 Release or assignment of title interest; rules; when and by whom required; exceptions. (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, upon the transfer of any interest shown on an Oregon title any person whose interest is released, terminated, assigned or transferred, shall release or assign that interest in a manner specified by the Department of Transportation by rule. Rules adopted for purposes of this subsection shall be designed, as much as possible, to protect the interests of all parties to the transfer. If required under ORS 803.102, the person shall also complete an odometer disclosure statement.

      (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section:

      (a) In the case of a transfer by operation of law of any interest shown on an Oregon title, the personal representative, receiver, trustee, sheriff or other representative or successor in interest of the person whose interest is transferred shall release or assign interest and if required by the department by rule, as provided under ORS 803.102, complete an odometer disclosure statement and shall provide the certificate, if any, and disclosure statement if required to the transferee. The representative or successor shall also provide the transferee with information satisfactory to the department concerning all facts entitling such representative or successor to transfer title. If there is no person to assign interest, the person to whom interest is awarded or otherwise transferred shall be responsible for the requirements of this paragraph.

      (b) In the case of a transfer at death of the interest of the owner, lessor or security interest holder if the estate is not being probated and title is not being transferred under the provisions of ORS 114.545, interest may be assigned through the use of an affidavit. The affidavit shall be on a form prescribed by the department and signed by all of the known heirs of the person whose interest is being transferred stating the name of the person to whom the ownership interest has been passed. If any heir has not arrived at the age of majority or is otherwise incapacitated, the parent or guardian of the heir shall sign the affidavit. In the case of a transfer under this paragraph, one of the heirs or any other person designated by the department by rule shall complete any odometer disclosure statement required under ORS 803.102.

      (c) In the case of a transfer at death of the interest of the owner, lessor or security interest holder where transfer occurs under the provisions of ORS 114.545, the “affiant” as defined in ORS 114.505 is the person required to assign interest. The department may designate by rule the affiant or any other person to complete any odometer disclosure statement required under ORS 803.102.

      (d) Upon the termination of a lease, in lieu of the lessee releasing interest, the lessor may provide information satisfactory to the department that the lease has been terminated. The lessor shall provide an odometer disclosure statement if required under ORS 803.102. If the lessor does not take possession of the vehicle upon termination of the lease, the information in the odometer disclosure given by the lessor may be taken from an odometer disclosure given by the lessee to the lessor under ORS 803.102 unless the lessor has reason to believe that the disclosure by the lessee does not reflect the actual mileage of the vehicle.

      (e) A security interest holder or lessor, without the consent of the owner, may assign interest of the holder or lessor in a vehicle to a person other than the owner without affecting the interest of the owner or the validity or priority of the interest. A person not given notice of such assignment is protected in dealing with the security interest holder or lessor as the holder of the interest until the assignee files in accordance with ORS chapter 79. This paragraph does not exempt such assignments from title transfer requirements.

      (3) Nothing in this section requires the release or assignment of title upon the creation or termination of a leasehold interest for a vehicle that is proportionally registered under ORS 826.009 or 826.011 if the department is furnished with satisfactory proof of the lease for such vehicle.

      (4) The department by rule may allow odometer disclosure statements to be on a form other than the certificate of title.

      (5) Persons subject to the provisions of this section shall provide to the transferee a title certificate, if one has been issued and is in their possession, the release or assignment of interest, and any required odometer disclosure statement. If an odometer disclosure statement is required, the transferee shall provide a signed disclosure to the transferor in a form determined by the department by rule. [1989 c.148 §2; 1991 c.67 §213; 1991 c.873 §13; 1993 c.233 §30; 2001 c.675 §10; 2003 c.655 §103]

 

      803.095 [1983 c.338 §189; 1985 c.16 §65; 1985 c.251 §17; 1985 c.300 §4; 1985 c.400 §2; 1985 c.485 §5; 1987 c.750 §4; 1989 c.43 §18; repealed by 1989 c.148 §20]

 

      803.097 Perfection of security interest in vehicle; rules. (1) Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, the exclusive means for perfecting a security interest in a vehicle is by application for notation of the security interest on the title in accordance with this section. The application may accompany the application for a title or may be made separately at any time prior to issuance of title and must be accompanied by evidence of ownership as defined by the Department of Transportation by rule unless the department is in possession of evidence of ownership when it receives the application. If title to the vehicle has been issued in a form other than a certificate, and the title reflects a security interest, the application for perfection shall include authorization from the previous security interest holder for the new security interest to be recorded on the title. Authorization under this subsection is not required if:

      (a) A release of interest is submitted by the prior security interest holder or the department is otherwise satisfied that the prior holder no longer holds an interest or is otherwise not entitled to title to the vehicle;

      (b) The security interest is being added to the title in conjunction with the cancellation of previous title or other action the department takes to correct ownership information reflected on a title; or

      (c) Title is being transferred by operation of law.

      (2) When the department processes an application for a security interest the department shall mark on the application or otherwise indicate on the record the date the application was first received by the department. The department shall determine by rule what constitutes receipt of an application for purposes of this subsection.

      (3) If the department has the evidence required by subsection (1) of this section and if the application contains the name of each owner of the vehicle, the name and address of the secured party and the vehicle identification number of the collateral, the security interest is perfected as of the date marked on the application or indicated in the record by the department. If the application does not contain the information required by this subsection, or if the department does not have the required evidence, the department shall indicate on the application or on the record that the date placed on the application or the record pursuant to subsection (2) of this section is not the date of perfection of the security interest.

      (4) The security interest remains effective until released or terminated by the secured party.

      (5) A security interest in a vehicle may not be perfected as described under this section but is subject to the perfection provisions under ORS chapter 79 if:

      (a) The debtor who granted the security interest is in the business of selling vehicles and the vehicle constitutes inventory held for sale or lease; or

      (b) The vehicle is exempt from titling requirements under ORS 803.030. [1987 c.750 §2; 1989 c.148 §13; 1993 c.233 §31; 2001 c.445 §184; 2001 c.675 §11a; 2003 c.655 §104; 2012 c.12 §23]

 

      803.098 Certain transactions that do not create security interest. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in the case of motor vehicles or trailers, a transaction does not create a sale or security interest merely because it provides that the rental price is permitted or required to be adjusted under the agreement either upward or downward by reference to the amount realized upon sale or other disposition of the motor vehicle or trailer. [1993 c.646 §25]

 

      803.100 Application of Uniform Commercial Code. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the rights and remedies of all persons in vehicles subject to security interests established under ORS 803.097 are determined by the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code.

      (2)(a) If perfection of a security interest in a vehicle occurs on or before 30 days after attachment of the security interest, the secured party takes priority over the rights of a transferee in bulk or a lien creditor that arise between the time the secured party’s interest attaches and the time of perfection of the security interest.

      (b) This subsection applies to any security interest in a vehicle that is not a purchase money security interest. [1983 c.338 §190; 1985 c.16 §66; 1989 c.148 §14; 1999 c.818 §3; 2001 c.675 §12; 2003 c.655 §105; 2005 c.261 §1]

The lessee shall furnish the lessor with a form that complies with the requirements of ORS 803.120 and shall provide the information required by ORS 803.122 except that for purposes of the required information, the lessee shall be considered the transferor, the lessor shall be considered the transferee and the date shall be the date of the disclosure statement.

      (4) Where an interest in a vehicle is transferred by operation of law, the Department of Transportation shall determine by rule whether an odometer disclosure statement is required and if so, who is required to provide it.

      (5) The odometer disclosure requirements of this section do not apply upon transfer of an interest where the transfer is due solely to the creation, release or assignment of a security interest, or upon transfer of an interest in any of the following:

      (b) Shall not issue title within 30 days of giving the notice required by paragraph (a) of this subsection unless the department is notified before the end of the 30 days that the vehicle is not stolen. After the passage of the 30-day period, the department may issue the title.

      803.105 Failure to deliver documents on transfer; late fee; penalty.

      (a) Upon transfer of title or any interest in a vehicle, the transferee shall present the certificate of title to the department within 30 days after the transfer. This paragraph does not apply to a vehicle dealer. If the transfer arises from the sale of a vehicle, a transferee who presents the certificate more than 30 days after the transfer shall pay the fee for late presentation of certificate of title established in ORS 803.090. However, the fee for late presentation does not apply if the transferee proves to the satisfaction of the department that:

      (B) Failure to comply was for a reason beyond the control of the transferee.

      (b) Upon transfer of title or any interest in a vehicle to a vehicle dealer, the vehicle dealer shall immediately notify the department that the vehicle has been transferred to the dealer.

      (f) Upon the creation of a security interest in a vehicle where the owner or lessor is in possession of a certificate of title, the owner or lessor, if there is a lease, shall deliver the certificate to the person in whom the security interest was created. This paragraph does not apply upon the creation of a security interest where the debtor who granted the security interest is in the business of selling vehicles and the vehicle constitutes inventory held for sale.

      (g) Upon the creation of a security interest in a vehicle where a prior security interest holder is in possession of the certificate of title, the owner or lessor, if there is a lease, shall either provide for the delivery of the certificate of title to the person in whom the security was created or arrange for direct delivery by the prior security interest holder to the department. This paragraph does not apply upon the creation of a security interest where the debtor who granted the security interest is in the business of selling vehicles and the vehicle constitutes inventory held for sale.

      (h) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, upon creation of a security interest in a vehicle, a person in whom a security interest was created and who receives a certificate of title showing the interest from the person granting the security interest shall present the certificate of title to the department within 30 days after receiving the certificate of title.

      (k) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, upon satisfaction of a security interest in a vehicle, the holder of the certificate of title and the release shall present both to the department within 30 days after the date of the release. This paragraph does not apply upon release of a security interest in vehicles where the debtor who granted the security interest is in the business of selling vehicles and the vehicle constitutes inventory held for sale.

      (2) The offense described in this section, failure to deliver vehicle documents on transfer of interest in a vehicle, is a Class D traffic violation.

(Periods and Fees)

 

      803.400 Duration of registration periods. This section establishes and distinguishes registration periods. Each registration period determines the period of validity for vehicle registration. Registration under the following registration periods is valid during the described registration period:

      (1)(a) Annual registration is valid for a one-year period. Except as provided in this subsection, the period starts on the first day of a calendar month and runs through the last day of the same calendar month one year later. Once a vehicle is registered under annual registration, the registration period of the vehicle begins and ends with that same calendar month each time the vehicle is reregistered or registration for the vehicle is renewed.

      (b) Annual registration issued under ORS 803.415 (11) starts on the day a vehicle is registered and runs through the same day one year later. Once a vehicle is registered annually under ORS 803.415 (11), the registration period of the vehicle begins and ends with that same day each time the vehicle is reregistered or registration for the vehicle is renewed. Vehicles initially registered on February 29 will expire on the last day of February at the end of the registration period.

      (2) Biennial registration is valid for a two-year period. The period starts on the day a vehicle is registered and runs through the same day two years later. Once a vehicle is registered under biennial registration, the registration period of the vehicle begins and ends with that same day each time the vehicle is reregistered or registration for the vehicle is renewed. Vehicles initially registered on February 29 will expire on the last day of February two years later.

      (3) Calendar-year registration starts on January 1 of a year and runs through December 31 of the same year.

      (4) Ownership registration starts on the day the vehicle is registered and is valid until the ownership of the vehicle changes.

      (5) Permanent registration starts on the day the vehicle is registered and is valid for the life of the vehicle.

      (6) Quarterly registration starts on the first day of any calendar quarter and runs through the last day of the last calendar quarter in the registration period. The number of calendar quarters in a quarterly registration is elected by the vehicle owner at the time of registration. A person may not establish quarterly registration periods for more than four quarters. If a vehicle is registered for a quarterly registration period of less than four calendar quarters, the Department of Transportation shall collect, when issuing or renewing registration of the vehicle, the additional fee for quarterly registration established under ORS 803.420.

      (7) Four-year registration starts on the day a vehicle is registered and runs through the same day four years later. [1983 c.338 §222; 1989 c.76 §1; 1993 c.174 §4; 2001 c.124 §2; 2005 c.280 §1]

      (3) The authority granted under this section includes authority to adjust the initial registration period of travel trailers and special use trailers that are required to be registered after being removed from assessment under the ad valorem tax laws by ORS 820.520.

VEHICLE PERMITS

 

      803.600 Trip permits; authority granted; types; records; rules; when not required. A trip permit grants authority to temporarily operate a vehicle on the highways of this state under circumstances where the operation would not otherwise be legal because the vehicle is not registered by this state or because provisions relating to the vehicle’s registration do not allow the operation. The Department of Transportation shall provide for the issuance of trip permits in a manner consistent with this section. All of the following apply to permits issued under this section:

      (1) The department shall issue the following types of trip permits to authorize the described type of operation and, except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, may not issue trip permits for any other purpose:

      (a) A heavy motor vehicle trip permit may be issued for a motor vehicle with a combined weight or loaded weight of more than 8,000 pounds or that is a fixed load motor vehicle, and that is not registered in this state. A permit described in this paragraph is valid for 10 consecutive days.

      (b) A heavy trailer trip permit may be issued for a trailer that will be operated on the highways at a loaded weight of more than 8,000 pounds or that is a fixed load vehicle, and that is not registered to allow operation of the vehicle in this state.

Permits described in this paragraph may be issued for a period of 21 consecutive days. The department may not issue more than two permits under this paragraph in a 12-month period for any one vehicle unless all registered owners of the vehicle are replaced by new owners. If there is a complete change in ownership of the vehicle, as shown by the registration records for the vehicle, a new owner may receive permits for the vehicle under this paragraph as if no permits had been issued for the vehicle. This paragraph does not apply to campers, travel trailers or motor homes, which are eligible for recreational vehicle trip permits under paragraph (d) of this subsection.

      (d) A recreational vehicle trip permit may be issued for a period of up to 10 consecutive days for a camper, travel trailer or motor home that is not registered for operation in this state.

A person may not receive recreational vehicle trip permits authorizing more than 10 days of operation in any 12-month period.

A permit issued under this paragraph does not authorize movements or operations for which a variance permit is required under ORS 818.200. A permit issued under this paragraph shall show the maximum registration weight allowed for operation under the permit. A permit issued under this paragraph is valid for 10 consecutive days.

      (f) A registered vehicle trip permit may be issued for a vehicle that is registered in this state to allow the vehicle to operate under conditions or in ways not permitted by the terms of the vehicle registration.
