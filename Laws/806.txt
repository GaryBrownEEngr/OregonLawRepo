      (2) The use of an electronic device to display proof of insurance does not constitute consent for a police officer to access other contents of the electronic device.

      (3) Failure of the driver of a motor vehicle to show proof of insurance or other current proof of compliance when asked to do so by a police officer is reasonable grounds for the officer to believe that the person is operating the vehicle in violation of ORS 806.010.

(Self-Insurance)

 

      806.130 Self-insurance. (1) To qualify as a self-insurer for purposes of financial responsibility requirements under ORS 806.060, a person must do all of the following:

      (a) Apply to the Department of Transportation and be issued by the department a certificate of self-insurance under ORS 806.140.

      (b) Either:

      (A) Establish to the satisfaction of the department that the person possesses and will continue to possess the ability to pay and discharge judgments described under ORS 806.040 that might be obtained against the applicant; or

      (c) Agree to provide the same coverage and to pay the same amounts with respect to an accident occurring while the certificate is in force that an insurer would be obligated to provide and to pay under a motor vehicle liability insurance policy, including providing the coverage required under ORS 806.080 (1)(b) and uninsured motorist coverage and liability coverage to at least the limits specified in ORS 806.070.

      (2)(a) If an accident occurs while a certificate of self-insurance issued under ORS 806.140 is in force, the liability protection provided and the amounts paid under subsection (1)(c) of this section are secondary to any motor vehicle liability insurance or uninsured motorist coverage available to a customer of the self-insurer, an operator of the self-insured vehicle or an occupant of the self-insured vehicle unless otherwise agreed to by the self-insurer. A self-insurer is required to provide the minimum payments established under ORS 742.502 and 806.070 only when the motor vehicle liability insurance policy of a customer of the self-insurer or an operator of the self-insured vehicle does not provide the minimum required payments established in ORS 742.502 and 806.070.

      (b) A self-insurer may recover from a customer of the self-insurer or an operator of the self-insured vehicle the amounts paid under subsection (1)(c) of this section.

      (3) Nothing in this section requires a self-insurer to provide liability coverage when a person is operating the vehicle without permission of the self-insurer. [1983 c.338 §849; 1985 c.16 §430; 2007 c.287 §1]

 

      806.140 Certificate; issuance; cancellation. (1) The Department of Transportation shall issue a certificate of self-insurance for purposes of financial responsibility requirements under ORS 806.060 and future responsibility filings under ORS 806.240 to any person who qualifies under ORS 806.130.

      (2) The department may cancel a certificate of self-insurance issued under this section upon reasonable grounds. Failure to pay any judgment described under ORS 806.040 within 30 days after it has become final constitutes reasonable grounds for cancellation under this subsection. The department shall give not less than five days’ notice and a hearing pursuant to such notice before the department may cancel under this subsection. [1983 c.338 §850]

 

ENFORCEMENT

 

      806.150 Department verification program; rules.

In addition, the department may seek verification by communicating directly with an insurer or its designee.

      (4) Failure of an owner either to return the certification of compliance with financial responsibility requirements to the department within 30 days after mailing by the department or to certify compliance as of the date of the letter, or a determination by the department that a certification is not accurate constitutes reasonable grounds for the department to proceed with a demand for verification under ORS 806.160.

      (5) The department shall investigate all certifications returned to the department under this section as follows:

      (a) If the owner certifies the existence of insurance described under ORS 806.080, the department shall forward the certification to the listed insurer to determine whether the certification is correct. An insurer shall notify the department if the certification is not correct.

      (b) The department may also determine the correctness of certifications of other means of satisfying financial responsibility requirements for the vehicle.

      (6) No civil liability shall accrue to the insurer or any of its employees for reports made to the department under this section when the reports are made in good faith based on the most recent information available to the insurer.

      (a) Driving uninsured under ORS 806.010.

      (b) Falsification of financial responsibility under ORS 806.050.

      (a) That the person was in fact in compliance with financial responsibility requirements as of the date of the department’s letter of verification under ORS 806.150; or

      (b) That the person reasonably and in good faith believed that the person was in compliance with financial responsibility requirements on the date of the department’s letter of verification.

      806.260 [1983 c.338 §861; repealed by 2003 c.175 §1]

 

      806.270 Certificate of insurance; requirements; presumption of completeness. (1) A certificate of insurance that is used to comply with future responsibility filing requirements under ORS 806.240 is subject to all of the following:

      (a) Except as provided by ORS 806.280, the certificate must be issued by an insurance carrier doing business in this state.

      (b) The certificate must show that the person required to make the future responsibility filing is covered by insurance that provides minimum coverage necessary for payment of the schedule of payments under ORS 806.070.

      (c) The certificate must show that the person required to make the future responsibility filing is either:

      (A) Insured by a policy meeting the requirements under ORS 806.080 that also covers all other persons who, with the consent of the insured, use the vehicles owned by the person making the filing; or

      (B) Insured against loss arising from liabilities imposed by law for damages arising out of the ownership, operation, use or maintenance of motor vehicles not owned by the person required to make the filing.

      (e) The certificate must provide that the insurers will give the Department of Transportation notice of any cancellation of the policy within 10 days after the effective date of the cancellation or termination. The notice requirement under this paragraph does not apply where the insurance is terminated under ORS 806.290.

      (2) The certificate or certificates must cover all vehicles that are registered in the name of or operated by the person, except vehicles that are in storage and for which the current registration plates and cards have been surrendered to the department.

      806.280 When certificate of insurer not authorized to do business in this state may be used.

[1983 c.338 §863; 2003 c.175 §9; 2009 c.257 §9]

 

      806.290 Automatic termination of insurance under future responsibility filing upon subsequent filing. An insurance policy for which a certificate of insurance is filed to comply with future responsibility requirements is terminated with respect to any operator or vehicle designated in the certificate if the operator or vehicle is also covered by an insurance policy subsequently procured and certified to the Department of Transportation. The date of termination under this section is the date the subsequent certificate is filed with the department. [1983 c.338 §864]

 

      806.300 Failure to surrender license and registration on cancellation of future responsibility filing; penalty. (1) A person commits the offense of failure to surrender license and registration on cancellation of future responsibility filing if the person does not immediately return the person’s license or driver permit and registration to the Department of Transportation when any of the following occur:
