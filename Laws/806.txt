      (2) The use of an electronic device to display proof of insurance does not constitute consent for a police officer to access other contents of the electronic device.

      (3) Failure of the driver of a motor vehicle to show proof of insurance or other current proof of compliance when asked to do so by a police officer is reasonable grounds for the officer to believe that the person is operating the vehicle in violation of ORS 806.010.

      (3) This section does not apply:

(Self-Insurance)

 

      806.130 Self-insurance. (1) To qualify as a self-insurer for purposes of financial responsibility requirements under ORS 806.060, a person must do all of the following:

      (a) Apply to the Department of Transportation and be issued by the department a certificate of self-insurance under ORS 806.140.

      (b) Either:

      (A) Establish to the satisfaction of the department that the person possesses and will continue to possess the ability to pay and discharge judgments described under ORS 806.040 that might be obtained against the applicant; or

      (B) Be qualified under the laws of the State of Oregon or under an ordinance of a city of this state to act as a self-insurer and be acting as a self-insurer.

      (c) Agree to provide the same coverage and to pay the same amounts with respect to an accident occurring while the certificate is in force that an insurer would be obligated to provide and to pay under a motor vehicle liability insurance policy, including providing the coverage required under ORS 806.080 (1)(b) and uninsured motorist coverage and liability coverage to at least the limits specified in ORS 806.070.

      (d) Have more than 25 motor vehicles including commercial buses registered in the person’s name.

      (2)(a) If an accident occurs while a certificate of self-insurance issued under ORS 806.140 is in force, the liability protection provided and the amounts paid under subsection (1)(c) of this section are secondary to any motor vehicle liability insurance or uninsured motorist coverage available to a customer of the self-insurer, an operator of the self-insured vehicle or an occupant of the self-insured vehicle unless otherwise agreed to by the self-insurer. A self-insurer is required to provide the minimum payments established under ORS 742.502 and 806.070 only when the motor vehicle liability insurance policy of a customer of the self-insurer or an operator of the self-insured vehicle does not provide the minimum required payments established in ORS 742.502 and 806.070.

      (b) A self-insurer may recover from a customer of the self-insurer or an operator of the self-insured vehicle the amounts paid under subsection (1)(c) of this section.

      (3) Nothing in this section requires a self-insurer to provide liability coverage when a person is operating the vehicle without permission of the self-insurer. [1983 c.338 §849; 1985 c.16 §430; 2007 c.287 §1]

 

      806.140 Certificate; issuance; cancellation. (1) The Department of Transportation shall issue a certificate of self-insurance for purposes of financial responsibility requirements under ORS 806.060 and future responsibility filings under ORS 806.240 to any person who qualifies under ORS 806.130.

      (2) The department may cancel a certificate of self-insurance issued under this section upon reasonable grounds. Failure to pay any judgment described under ORS 806.040 within 30 days after it has become final constitutes reasonable grounds for cancellation under this subsection. The department shall give not less than five days’ notice and a hearing pursuant to such notice before the department may cancel under this subsection. [1983 c.338 §850]

 

ENFORCEMENT

 

      806.150 Department verification program; rules. The Department of Transportation shall establish by rule a program to verify compliance with the financial responsibility requirements of operating a motor vehicle in this state. The program established under this section shall comply with all of the following:

      (1) The department may select vehicles registered in this state for verification when the department considers the selection necessary or appropriate. The department may emphasize verification of vehicles registered to individuals who:

      (a) Have been convicted of violating ORS 806.010;

      (b) Require the owner to provide proof of compliance with financial responsibility requirements within the time specified by the department by rule.

      (3) After the department receives proof of compliance from a registered owner as required under subsection (2) of this section, the department shall forward the proof of compliance to the listed insurer, or use other means, to determine whether the proof of compliance is correct. An insurer shall notify the department if the proof of compliance is not correct within the time specified by the department by rule.

      (4) Civil liability does not accrue to the insurer or any of its employees for reports made to the department under this section when the reports are made in good faith based on the most recent information available to the insurer. [1983 c.338 §851; 1985 c.16 §431; 1985 c.714 §2; 1987 c.158 §165; 1993 c.751 §29; 2005 c.142 §1; 2019 c.312 §1]

 

      Note: The amendments to 806.150 by section 1, chapter 312, Oregon Laws 2019, become operative July 1, 2020. See section 37, chapter 312, Oregon Laws 2019. The text that is operative until July 1, 2020, is set forth for the user’s convenience.

      806.150. The Department of Transportation shall provide a program of verification of compliance with financial responsibility requirements under ORS 803.460 and 806.010. The program established by the department under this section shall comply with all of the following:

      (1) The verification shall be based on motor vehicles registered in this state.

      (2) The department may select vehicles for verification when the department considers the selection necessary or appropriate. The department may emphasize, in accordance with rules adopted by the department, verification of vehicles registered to individuals who:

      (b) Have submitted certifications of compliance with financial responsibility requirements that have been previously found to be incorrect; or

      (c) The department has reasonable grounds to believe are not in compliance with financial responsibility requirements.

      (3) When a vehicle is selected for verification under this section, the department shall mail a letter and certification form described under ORS 806.180 to the registered owner of the vehicle notifying the owner that the vehicle has been selected for verification and requiring the owner to respond within 30 days and certify that the owner is in compliance with financial responsibility requirements as of the date of the letter. In addition, the department may seek verification by communicating directly with an insurer or its designee.

      (4) Failure of an owner either to return the certification of compliance with financial responsibility requirements to the department within 30 days after mailing by the department or to certify compliance as of the date of the letter, or a determination by the department that a certification is not accurate constitutes reasonable grounds for the department to proceed with a demand for verification under ORS 806.160.

      (5) The department shall investigate all certifications returned to the department under this section as follows:

      (a) If the owner certifies the existence of insurance described under ORS 806.080, the department shall forward the certification to the listed insurer to determine whether the certification is correct. An insurer shall notify the department if the certification is not correct.

      (b) The department may also determine the correctness of certifications of other means of satisfying financial responsibility requirements for the vehicle.

      (6) No civil liability shall accrue to the insurer or any of its employees for reports made to the department under this section when the reports are made in good faith based on the most recent information available to the insurer.

 

      Note: 806.160 was repealed by section 36, chapter 312, Oregon Laws 2019. The text of 806.150 that is operative until July 1, 2020, was not amended by enactment of the Legislative Assembly to reflect the repeal. Editorial adjustment of 806.150 for the repeal of 806.160 has not been made.

[1983 c.338 §853; 2009 c.257 §3]

 

      806.180 Information to be provided when certification of compliance required. A person who is required under ORS 803.460 or 811.725 to provide proof of compliance with financial responsibility requirements shall certify proof of compliance in a manner prescribed by the Department of Transportation by rule and shall provide any information that the department requires.
