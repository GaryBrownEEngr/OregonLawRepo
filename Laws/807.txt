Except as otherwise provided in this section, an instruction driver permit is subject to the fees, provisions, conditions, prohibitions and penalties applicable to a license or endorsement granting the same driving privileges. The following apply to an instruction driver permit:

      (1) An instruction driver permit is subject to the same classifications and endorsements as a license. The department may issue an instruction driver permit to grant the same driving privileges as a Class C driver license or as a motorcycle endorsement, but the instruction driver permit will also be subject to the provisions of this section.

      (a) Within one year of the expiration of an instruction driver permit issued under this section; or

      (b) Within six months after the applicant is discharged from the Armed Forces of the United States if the applicant held an instruction driver permit issued by this state at the time of the applicant’s entry into the Armed Forces.

      (7) An instruction driver permit that is renewed under this section may be used on or after the date of issuance. If the department issues an instruction driver permit renewal to a person under this section before the expiration of the instruction driver permit being renewed, the older permit is invalid.

      807.745 Findings regarding personal information contained in driver licenses, driver permits and identification cards. The Legislative Assembly finds that:

      (1) Oregon recognizes the importance of protecting the confidentiality and privacy of an individual’s personal information contained in driver licenses, driver permits and identification cards.

      (2) Machine-readable features found on driver licenses, driver permits and identification cards are intended to facilitate verification of age or identity, not to facilitate collection of personal information about individuals nor to facilitate the creation of private databases of transactional information associated with those individuals.

      (3) Easy access to the information found on driver licenses, driver permits and identification cards facilitates the crime of identity theft, which is a major concern in Oregon. [2009 c.546 §1]
