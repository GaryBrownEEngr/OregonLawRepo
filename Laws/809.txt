The requirement to order the suspension of vehicle registration under this section is subject to all of the following:

      (1) The court shall order the department to suspend the registration under this section when a person is convicted:

      (a) Of driving a motor vehicle while the person’s license is suspended or revoked in violation of ORS 811.175 or 811.182; or

      (b) On a second or subsequent charge of driving while under the influence of intoxicants in violation of ORS 813.010.

      (3) A court may not issue an order to suspend the registration under this section for more than 120 days.

      (4) Upon issuing an order to suspend the registration under this section, a court shall issue a copy of the order to the department for suspension according to ORS 809.020.

      (5) The court may order, under this section, the department to suspend the registration of a motor vehicle of which the convicted person is not the owner only if the court is satisfied by clear and convincing evidence that the owner knew or had good reason to know that the convicted person:

      (a) Did not have a valid license and knowingly consented to the operation of the vehicle by the convicted person; or

      (b) Was operating the vehicle while under the influence of intoxicants. [1983 c.338 §386; 1985 c.16 §202; 1985 c.173 §6; 1987 c.730 §13; 1991 c.407 §30]

 

      809.020 Response to court-ordered suspension.

      (a) A judgment of the type described under ORS 806.040 was rendered against the person.

      (b) The judgment has remained unsettled as described by ORS 809.470 for 60 days.

      (c) The judgment continues to be unsettled.

      (d) At the time of the accident that is the source of the judgment, the employee was driving, with the permission of the employer, a vehicle owned, operated or leased by the employer. [1983 c.338 §284; 1985 c.16 §116; 1999 c.359 §2; 2011 c.355 §28]

      (2) If any person fails to return registration plates or cards as required by this section, the department may request any peace officer to secure possession thereof and return it to the department.

      809.090 Cancellation of registration or title for failure to qualify; notice; rules. (1) The Department of Transportation may cancel the registration or title or both of a vehicle if the department determines that:

      809.120 Court-ordered suspension of registration or driving privileges for weight violation. (1) In addition to any other punishment imposed under ORS 818.040, a convicting court has authority to order the suspension of the driving privileges of the operator of the vehicle used to violate ORS 818.040 or the registration of the vehicle if the vehicle is required to be registered by the Department of Transportation. The authority of a court to order the suspension of driving privileges or registration under this section is subject to the following:

      (a) Subject to paragraph (b) of this subsection, the court may only order suspension for a period of up to 90 days.

      (b) For a second or subsequent violation of ORS 818.040, within one year after the first conviction, the court shall order the suspension for not less than 30 days nor more than 90 days.

      (2) Upon ordering a suspension under this section, a court shall secure the license, driver permit or registration plates ordered suspended and shall immediately forward them to the department with the order of suspension as provided under ORS 809.275.

      (3) Upon receipt of an order under this section, the department shall proceed as provided under ORS 809.020 or 809.280. [1983 c.338 §390; 1985 c.16 §207; 1991 c.407 §31; 2011 c.355 §3]

 

      809.130 Suspension or revocation of registration or driving privileges for unsettled judgment. (1) If a court notifies the Department of Transportation under this section that a judgment remains unsettled as described by ORS 809.470, the department must initiate action to determine whether to suspend or revoke driving privileges under ORS 809.415 or vehicle registration of the employer under ORS 809.020. A court shall immediately give the department notice of an unsettled judgment under this section if:

      (a) A judgment of the type described under ORS 806.040 is rendered against a person by a court of this state;

      (b) The person fails within 60 days to settle the judgment in the manner required under ORS 809.470; and

[Formerly 809.060; 2018 c.76 §25]

 

      809.140 Administrative review of suspension, revocation or cancellation of identification card, registration or driving privileges. (1) Unless otherwise specifically provided by law, a person whose identification card, vehicle registration or driving privileges are suspended, revoked or canceled by the Department of Transportation is entitled to administrative review of the action rather than to a formal hearing by the department if the suspension, revocation or cancellation is based upon:

      (a) A conviction;

      (b) Notification from a court that the court has ordered suspension, revocation or cancellation; or

      (c) Notice from a court to the department to suspend, cancel or revoke.

If the bureau verifies that the person is enrolled in a preapprenticeship program or is registered as an apprentice, the bureau shall include the verification on the form described in this subsection.

      (d) If the court receives a notice from the program that the person has failed to complete the program, or failed to register as an apprentice under ORS 660.020 after completion of a preapprenticeship program, the court shall reissue the notice of suspension.

      (a) ORS 809.310 (3)(a);

      (b) ORS 809.310 (3)(b); and

      (3) To make a request under subsection (1) of this section, the person must provide sufficient proof for the department to make the determinations required in subsection (4) of this section.

      (4) The granting of an administrative review under this section does not stay the suspension. However, the department shall reinstate the person’s driving privileges or right to apply for driving privileges or identification card or right to apply for an identification card if under objective criteria adopted by the department by rule, the department determines the suspension resulted from:

      (a) An act described in ORS 809.310 (3)(a) or (b) committed by the person when the person was under 21 years of age; and

      (b) The person committed the act solely for the purpose of:

      (8) The department’s authority to reinstate a suspension of a person’s driving privileges or right to apply for driving privileges under this section does not impinge on a court’s authority to impose a suspension under ORS 165.805 or 471.430. [2012 c.14 §2; 2013 c.237 §46; 2018 c.114 §6; 2019 c.15 §2]

      809.360 General provisions relating to suspension or revocation of driving privileges. (1) For purposes of determining whether grounds exist for revoking or suspending driving privileges, an unvacated forfeiture of bail in another state equals a conviction.

      (2) A suspension or revocation of driving privileges ordered by a court shall run concurrently with any mandatory suspension or revocation ordered by the Department of Transportation and arising out of the same conviction.

      (3) Judicial review of orders denying, suspending or revoking a license, except where such suspension or revocation is mandatory, shall be as provided in ORS chapter 183.

      (4) Whenever the department or a court has reason under any laws of this state to suspend or revoke the driving privileges of any person who does not hold current driving privileges to operate motor vehicles or whose driving privileges are due to expire during a suspension period, the department or court shall suspend or revoke the right of such person to apply for driving privileges to operate motor vehicles in this state. A suspension or revocation of a right to apply for driving privileges under this subsection shall be for the period provided by law. [1983 c.338 §348; 1987 c.272 §2; 1989 c.636 §34; 1999 c.1051 §282; 2003 c.14 §487; 2007 c.122 §6; 2013 c.237 §16]

      809.380 Period of suspension; effect; reinstatement; fee. All of the following apply to a person whose driving privileges have been suspended:

      (1) The period of suspension shall last as long as provided for that particular suspension by law.

      (2) During the period of suspension, the person is not entitled to exercise any driving privileges in this state except as provided under this subsection. Unless otherwise specifically provided by law, a person whose driving privileges are suspended may obtain, if the person qualifies, a hardship driver permit under ORS 807.240, and exercise driving privileges under the driver permit.

      (3) Upon expiration of the suspension, the Department of Transportation shall reissue, upon request of the person, the suspended driving privileges and any license or driver permit that evidences the driving privileges. The reissuance shall be without requalification by the person except that the department may require the person to furnish evidence satisfactory to the department that the person is qualified to continue to exercise driving privileges in this state before the department reissues the driving privileges.

      (4) The department may not issue any driving privileges in contradiction to this section.

      (5) If the person fails to surrender to the department any license or driver permit issued as evidence of driving privileges that are suspended, the person is subject to the penalties under ORS 809.500.

      (6) No reinstatement of suspended driving privileges will be made by the department until the fee for reinstatement of suspended driving privileges established under ORS 807.370 is paid to or waived by the department. The department may waive the reinstatement fee for any of the following reasons:

      (a) The suspension occurred under ORS 809.419 for failure to take an examination upon request of the department under ORS 807.340.

      (b) The suspension occurred under ORS 809.419 for failure to obtain required medical clearance upon request of the department under ORS 807.070 or 807.090.

      (c) The suspension occurred under ORS 809.419 for incompetence to drive a motor vehicle or having a mental or physical condition or impairment that affects the person’s ability to safely operate a motor vehicle.

      (d) The suspension occurred under ORS 809.419 upon notification by the superintendent of a hospital under ORS 807.700 that a person should not drive.

      (e) The suspension occurred under ORS 809.419 upon notification by a court under ORS 810.375 that a person charged with a traffic offense has been found guilty except for insanity.

      (f) The department committed an error in issuing the suspension.

      (g) The suspension was the result of an error committed by an insurance company in issuing or failing to issue a certification of insurance or in canceling a certification of insurance filed with the department under ORS 806.270.

      (h) The department issued the suspension without error because the person failed to respond as required under ORS 806.150 or to furnish proof of exemption under ORS 806.210 from the filing requirement of ORS 806.200, but the department later determines that the person in fact was in compliance with financial responsibility requirements as of the date specified by the department by rule under ORS 806.150 or at the time of an accident described in ORS 806.200.

      (i) The department issued the suspension without error because the person was not in compliance with financial responsibility requirements as of the date specified by the department by rule under ORS 806.150 or at the time of an accident described in ORS 806.200, but the department later determines that the person reasonably and in good faith believed that the person was in compliance with financial responsibility requirements on the date specified by the department by rule under ORS 806.150 or at the time of the accident.

      (j) The suspension was the result of an error committed by an insurance company in notifying the department regarding the correctness of proof of compliance with financial responsibility requirements provided under ORS 806.150.

      (k) The suspension occurred because the person failed to make future responsibility filings but the department later determines that the reason for the failure was that the person was a military reservist or a member of a national guard unit that was ordered to active military duty to a location outside of the United States. The effective date of the military orders must be prior to the effective date of a suspension issued by the department for failure to make a future responsibility filing.

      (L) The department issued the suspension without error because the department received a notice to suspend from a court under ORS 809.210 or 809.220, but the department later determines that the person in fact was in compliance with the requirements of the court prior to the effective date of the suspension. [1983 c.338 §350; 1985 c.16 §164; 1985 c.173 §1; 1985 c.393 §9; 1985 c.669 §17a; 1985 c.714 §8; 1987 c.137 §3; 1987 c.258 §8; 1987 c.272 §3; 1987 c.801 §7; 1989 c.224 §139; 1991 c.474 §1; 2003 c.402 §26; 2005 c.104 §1; 2005 c.140 §3; 2009 c.105 §1; 2017 c.66 §31; 2017 c.701 §25; 2018 c.76 §30; 2019 c.312 §10]

      (5) If the person fails to surrender to the department any license or driver permit issued as evidence of driving privileges that are suspended, the person is subject to the penalties under ORS 809.500.

      (6) No reinstatement of suspended driving privileges will be made by the department until the fee for reinstatement of suspended driving privileges established under ORS 807.370 is paid to or waived by the department. The department may waive the reinstatement fee for any of the following reasons:

      (a) The suspension occurred under ORS 809.419 for failure to take an examination upon request of the department under ORS 807.340.

      (b) The suspension occurred under ORS 809.419 for failure to obtain required medical clearance upon request of the department under ORS 807.070 or 807.090.

      (h) The department issued the suspension without error because the person failed to respond as required under ORS 806.160 or to furnish proof of exemption under ORS 806.210 from the filing requirement of ORS 806.200, but the department later determines that the person in fact was in compliance with financial responsibility requirements as of the date of the department’s letter of verification under ORS 806.150 or at the time of an accident described in ORS 806.200.

      (i) The department issued the suspension without error because the person was not in compliance with financial responsibility requirements as of the date of the department’s letter of verification under ORS 806.150 or at the time of an accident described in ORS 806.200, but the department later determines that the person reasonably and in good faith believed that the person was in compliance with financial responsibility requirements on the date of the department’s letter of verification or at the time of the accident.

      (j) The suspension was the result of an error committed by an insurance company in notifying the department regarding the correctness of a certification under ORS 806.150.

      809.700 Court-ordered impoundment or immobilization upon conviction; grounds; duration; vehicles subject; return; security interest holder rights. A court may order a motor vehicle impounded or immobilized upon conviction for the traffic offenses described in this section. The authority to impound or immobilize a vehicle under this section is subject to all of the following:

      (1) The court may order a vehicle impounded or immobilized under this section when a person is convicted:

      (a) For driving a motor vehicle while the person’s license is suspended or revoked in violation of ORS 811.175 or 811.182; or

      (b) On a second or subsequent charge of driving while under the influence of intoxicants in violation of ORS 813.010.

      (3) The following vehicles may be impounded under this section:

      (a) Any motor vehicle of which the convicted person is the owner.

      (b) Any motor vehicle which the convicted person is operating at the time of arrest.

      (4) A vehicle may be immobilized under this section if the vehicle is registered in this state and is a vehicle that may be impounded under subsection (3) of this section.

      (5)(a) If a vehicle is ordered to be immobilized under this section and if the convicted person resides in the jurisdiction of the law enforcement agency that arrested the person for the offense described in subsection (1) of this section, the arresting law enforcement agency shall install a vehicle immobilization device on the vehicle. If the convicted person does not reside in the jurisdiction of the law enforcement agency that arrested the person, the sheriff of the county in which the person resides shall install the device.

      (b) A vehicle ordered immobilized under this section shall be immobilized at the residence of the owner of the vehicle or at the location where the owner regularly parks the vehicle.

      (c) A vehicle ordered immobilized under this section may be immobilized only in a location at which the vehicle may be legally stored for the period of the immobilization order. If no location is available at which the vehicle may be legally stored, the vehicle may be impounded for the period of the immobilization order.

      (b) If a vehicle is immobilized under this section, the person convicted shall be liable for the expenses incurred in installation and removal of the vehicle immobilization device and for rental of the device during the period the device is installed on the vehicle, whether or not the vehicle is released to the person convicted.

      (7) A vehicle shall be released or returned to the person convicted or the owner only upon payment of the expenses incurred in the immobilization or towing and storage of the vehicle under this section.

      (8) If a vehicle is not reclaimed within 30 days after the time set for the return of the vehicle in an impounding order or release of the vehicle in an immobilization order, the vehicle may be disposed of in accordance with procedures under ORS 819.110 to 819.215.

      (9) The court may order that a motor vehicle of which the convicted person is not the owner be impounded or immobilized under this section only if the court is satisfied by a preponderance of the evidence that the owner knew or had good reason to know that the convicted person:

      (a) Did not have a valid license and knowingly consented to the operation of the vehicle by the convicted person; or

      (b) Was operating the vehicle while under the influence of intoxicants.

      (10) The authority to impound or immobilize a vehicle under this section is subject to the rights of a security interest holder under a security agreement executed before an arrest for violation of an offense for which the vehicle may be impounded or immobilized under this section.

      (a) Request in writing is made to the court;

      (b) If the vehicle has been impounded or immobilized, the security interest holder pays the expenses in towing and storage or in immobilization of the vehicle; and

If the vehicle is in private storage, the lien claimant shall transmit the written notice. [1983 c.338 §385; 1985 c.16 §200; 1987 c.730 §18; 1993 c.385 §3; 1997 c.540 §3; 1999 c.467 §2; 2009 c.371 §2]

 

      809.702 Tampering with vehicle immobilization device; penalty. (1) A person commits the offense of tampering with a vehicle immobilization device if the person does anything to a vehicle immobilization device that was ordered installed under ORS 809.700 that circumvents the operation of the device.

      (2) The offense described in this section, tampering with a vehicle immobilization device, is a Class A traffic violation. [1997 c.540 §5; 1999 c.467 §3]

 

      809.710 Authority to refuse to release vehicle to intoxicated person.

      (3) The impounding police agency shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the vehicle was being operated in violation of ORS 806.010, 807.010, 811.175, 811.182 or 813.010. The police officer who ordered the vehicle impounded may submit an affidavit to the hearings officer in lieu of making a personal appearance at the hearing.

      (4) If the hearings officer finds that the impoundment of the vehicle was proper, the hearings officer shall enter an order supporting the removal and shall find that the owner or person entitled to possession of the vehicle is liable for usual and customary towing and storage costs. The hearings officer may also find the owner or person entitled to possession of the vehicle liable for costs of the hearing.

      (5) If the hearings officer finds that impoundment of the vehicle was improper, the hearings officer shall order the vehicle released to the person entitled to possession and shall enter a finding that the owner or person entitled to possession of the vehicle is not liable for any towing or storage costs resulting from the impoundment. If there is a lien on the vehicle for towing and storage charges, the hearings officer shall order it paid by the impounding police agency.

      (6) A police agency may contract with another agency or entity to conduct hearings under this section. [Formerly 806.016; 1997 c.514 §4; 1999 c.1051 §284a; 2001 c.748 §3]

      (c) Payment to the police agency of an administrative fee determined by the agency to be sufficient to recover its actual administrative costs for the impoundment.

      (4) Notwithstanding subsection (3) of this section, a person who holds a security interest in the impounded vehicle may obtain release of the vehicle by paying the administrative fee.

      (5) When a person entitled to possession of the impounded vehicle has complied with the requirements of subsection (3) or (4) of this section, the impounding police agency shall authorize the person storing the vehicle to release it upon payment of any towing and storage costs.

      (7) Nothing in this section or ORS 809.716 limits either the authority of a city or county to adopt ordinances dealing with impounding of uninsured vehicles or the contents of such ordinances except that cities and counties shall comply with the notice requirements of subsection (2) of this section and ORS 809.725.

      (8) A police agency may not collect its fee under subsection (3)(c) of this section from a holder of a towing business certificate issued under ORS 822.205 unless the holder has first collected payment of any towing and storage charges associated with the impoundment.
