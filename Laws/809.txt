      (1) The court shall order the department to suspend the registration under this section when a person is convicted:

      (a) Of driving a motor vehicle while the person’s license is suspended or revoked in violation of ORS 811.175 or 811.182; or

      (5) The court may order, under this section, the department to suspend the registration of a motor vehicle of which the convicted person is not the owner only if the court is satisfied by clear and convincing evidence that the owner knew or had good reason to know that the convicted person:

      (a) Did not have a valid license and knowingly consented to the operation of the vehicle by the convicted person; or

      (b) Was operating the vehicle while under the influence of intoxicants. [1983 c.338 §386; 1985 c.16 §202; 1985 c.173 §6; 1987 c.730 §13; 1991 c.407 §30]

      (b) The judgment has remained unsettled as described by ORS 809.470 for 60 days.

      (c) The judgment continues to be unsettled.

      (d) At the time of the accident that is the source of the judgment, the employee was driving, with the permission of the employer, a vehicle owned, operated or leased by the employer. [1983 c.338 §284; 1985 c.16 §116; 1999 c.359 §2; 2011 c.355 §28]

The authority of a court to order the suspension of driving privileges or registration under this section is subject to the following:

      (a) Subject to paragraph (b) of this subsection, the court may only order suspension for a period of up to 90 days.

      (b) For a second or subsequent violation of ORS 818.040, within one year after the first conviction, the court shall order the suspension for not less than 30 days nor more than 90 days.

      (3) Upon receipt of an order under this section, the department shall proceed as provided under ORS 809.020 or 809.280. [1983 c.338 §390; 1985 c.16 §207; 1991 c.407 §31; 2011 c.355 §3]

 

      809.130 Suspension or revocation of registration or driving privileges for unsettled judgment.

A court shall immediately give the department notice of an unsettled judgment under this section if:

      (a) A judgment of the type described under ORS 806.040 is rendered against a person by a court of this state;

      (b) The person fails within 60 days to settle the judgment in the manner required under ORS 809.470; and

      809.135 Refusal to issue, revocation or suspension of driving privileges, identification card, registration or title for failure to use same name.

[Formerly 809.060]

 

      809.140 Administrative review of suspension, revocation or cancellation of identification card, registration or driving privileges. (1) Unless otherwise specifically provided by law, a person whose identification card, vehicle registration or driving privileges are suspended, revoked or canceled by the Department of Transportation is entitled to administrative review of the action rather than to a formal hearing by the department if the suspension, revocation or cancellation is based upon:

      (a) A conviction;

      (c) Notice from a court to the department to suspend, cancel or revoke.

      (b) ORS 809.310 (3)(b); and

      (3) To make a request under subsection (1) of this section, the person must provide sufficient proof for the department to make the determinations required in subsection (4) of this section.

      (4) The granting of an administrative review under this section does not stay the suspension.

      (a) An act described in ORS 809.310 (3)(a) or (b) committed by the person when the person was under 21 years of age; and

      (b) The person committed the act solely for the purpose of:

      (8) The department’s authority to reinstate a suspension of a person’s driving privileges or right to apply for driving privileges under this section does not impinge on a court’s authority to impose a suspension under ORS 165.805 or 471.430. [2012 c.14 §2; 2013 c.237 §46]

 

      809.320 Cancellation on written request of parent or legal guardian.

      809.360 General provisions relating to suspension or revocation of driving privileges. (1) For purposes of determining whether grounds exist for revoking or suspending driving privileges, an unvacated forfeiture of bail in another state equals a conviction.

      (3) Judicial review of orders denying, suspending or revoking a license, except where such suspension or revocation is mandatory, shall be as provided in ORS chapter 183.

      (4) Whenever the department or a court has reason under any laws of this state to suspend or revoke the driving privileges of any person who does not hold current driving privileges to operate motor vehicles or whose driving privileges are due to expire during a suspension period, the department or court shall suspend or revoke the right of such person to apply for driving privileges to operate motor vehicles in this state. A suspension or revocation of a right to apply for driving privileges under this subsection shall be for the period provided by law. [1983 c.338 §348; 1987 c.272 §2; 1989 c.636 §34; 1999 c.1051 §282; 2003 c.14 §487; 2007 c.122 §6; 2013 c.237 §16]

      (1) The period of suspension shall last as long as provided for that particular suspension by law.

      (2) During the period of suspension, the person is not entitled to exercise any driving privileges in this state except as provided under this subsection. Unless otherwise specifically provided by law, a person whose driving privileges are suspended may obtain, if the person qualifies, a hardship driver permit under ORS 807.240, and exercise driving privileges under the driver permit.

      (3) Upon expiration of the suspension, the Department of Transportation shall reissue, upon request of the person, the suspended driving privileges and any license or driver permit that evidences the driving privileges. The reissuance shall be without requalification by the person except that the department may require the person to furnish evidence satisfactory to the department that the person is qualified to continue to exercise driving privileges in this state before the department reissues the driving privileges.

      (4) The department may not issue any driving privileges in contradiction to this section.

      (5) If the person fails to surrender to the department any license or driver permit issued as evidence of driving privileges that are suspended, the person is subject to the penalties under ORS 809.500.

      (6) No reinstatement of suspended driving privileges will be made by the department until the fee for reinstatement of suspended driving privileges established under ORS 807.370 is paid to or waived by the department. The department may waive the reinstatement fee for any of the following reasons:

      (a) The suspension occurred under ORS 809.419 for failure to take an examination upon request of the department under ORS 807.340.

      (b) The suspension occurred under ORS 809.419 for failure to obtain required medical clearance upon request of the department under ORS 807.070 or 807.090.

      (c) The suspension occurred under ORS 809.419 for incompetence to drive a motor vehicle or having a mental or physical condition or impairment that affects the person’s ability to safely operate a motor vehicle.

      (d) The suspension occurred under ORS 809.419 upon notification by the superintendent of a hospital under ORS 807.700 that a person should not drive.

      (e) The suspension occurred under ORS 809.419 upon notification by a court under ORS 810.375 that a person charged with a traffic offense has been found guilty except for insanity.

      (f) The department committed an error in issuing the suspension.

      (g) The suspension was the result of an error committed by an insurance company in issuing or failing to issue a certification of insurance or in canceling a certification of insurance filed with the department under ORS 806.270.

      (h) The department issued the suspension without error because the person failed to respond as required under ORS 806.160 or to furnish proof of exemption under ORS 806.210 from the filing requirement of ORS 806.200, but the department later determines that the person in fact was in compliance with financial responsibility requirements as of the date of the department’s letter of verification under ORS 806.150 or at the time of an accident described in ORS 806.200.

      (i) The department issued the suspension without error because the person was not in compliance with financial responsibility requirements as of the date of the department’s letter of verification under ORS 806.150 or at the time of an accident described in ORS 806.200, but the department later determines that the person reasonably and in good faith believed that the person was in compliance with financial responsibility requirements on the date of the department’s letter of verification or at the time of the accident.

      (j) The suspension was the result of an error committed by an insurance company in notifying the department regarding the correctness of a certification under ORS 806.150.

      (k) The suspension occurred because the person failed to make future responsibility filings but the department later determines that the reason for the failure was that the person was a military reservist or a member of a national guard unit that was ordered to active military duty to a location outside of the United States. The effective date of the military orders must be prior to the effective date of a suspension issued by the department for failure to make a future responsibility filing.

      (L) The department issued the suspension without error because the department received a notice to suspend from a court under ORS 809.210 or 809.220, but the department later determines that the person in fact was in compliance with the requirements of the court prior to the effective date of the suspension.

      (7) The department shall waive the reinstatement fee for a person whose driving privileges were suspended under ORS 809.423 (2) if the person:

      (a) Has graduated from high school and provides the department with proof of graduation satisfactory to the department; or

      (b) Has received a certificate for passing an approved high school equivalency test such as the General Educational Development (GED) test from a community college and provides the department with proof of the certificate satisfactory to the department.

      (2) During the period of revocation, the person is not entitled to exercise any driving privileges in this state or to apply for or receive any driving privileges in this state except when a person who has been determined to be a habitual offender is permitted to obtain driving privileges under a probationary driving permit as described under ORS 807.270 and 809.650. This subsection prohibits the issuance of any driver permit, including a hardship permit described under ORS 807.240, to a person whose driving privileges or right to apply for driving privileges are revoked except as provided for the probationary driving permit under ORS 807.270.

      (3) Upon expiration of the revocation period, the person must reapply for driving privileges in the manner established by law and must reestablish the person’s eligibility for issuance of driving privileges. If driving privileges are revoked because the person is a habitual offender, the person must meet the additional eligibility requirements for reinstatement of driving privileges under ORS 809.650 and 809.660.

      (4) The Department of Transportation may issue new driving privileges to a person before the expiration of the revocation period if the person is otherwise entitled to be issued driving privileges and when, with reference to a conviction upon which the revocation was based, the Governor has pardoned the person of the crime.

      (5) The department shall not issue any driving privileges in contradiction to this section.

      (6) If the person fails to surrender to the department any license or driver permit issued as evidence of driving privileges that are revoked, the person is subject to the penalty under ORS 809.500.

      (7) No reinstatement of revoked driving privileges will be made by the department until the fee for reinstatement of revoked driving privileges established under ORS 807.370 is paid to or waived by the department. The department may waive the reinstatement fee if the department committed an error in issuing the revocation. [1983 c.338 §351; 1985 c.16 §165; 1985 c.393 §10; 1985 c.669 §1; 1987 c.801 §8]

(1)(a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the Department of Transportation may suspend or revoke the driving privileges of any resident of this state upon receiving notice of the conviction of such person in another jurisdiction of an offense therein that, if committed in this state, would be grounds for the suspension or revocation of the driving privileges of the person. A suspension or revocation under this subsection shall be initiated within 30 days of receipt of notice of the conviction. Violation of a suspension or revocation imposed under this subsection shall have the same legal effects and consequences as it would if the offense committed in the other jurisdiction had been committed in this jurisdiction.

      (b) The department may not suspend or revoke driving privileges under this subsection unless notice of conviction is received within 180 days of the date of the conviction.

      (2) The department may suspend or revoke the driving privileges of any resident of this state upon receiving notice from another state, territory, federal possession or district or province of Canada that the person’s driving privileges in that jurisdiction have been suspended or revoked.

The suspension or revocation under this subsection shall continue until the person suspended or revoked furnishes evidence of any of the following:

      (a) Compliance with the law of the other jurisdiction or the restoration of driving privileges in that jurisdiction.

      (b) That the revocation or suspension in the other jurisdiction was not under circumstances that would require the department to suspend or revoke the driving privileges of the person under the laws of this state.

      (3) A person is entitled to administrative review of a suspension under this section. [1983 c.338 §352; 1987 c.272 §4; 1987 c.730 §16; 1989 c.171 §90; 1989 c.398 §1; 1989 c.636 §35; 1991 c.595 §1; 1991 c.702 §11; 2005 c.649 §24]

The department shall immediately suspend commercial driving privileges under this subsection without hearing, but the person may request a post-imposition hearing under ORS 809.440 (4), without regard to any hearings conducted by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. The period of a suspension under this section is the period of suspension prescribed by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, or one year, whichever is shorter. [2013 c.237 §5]
