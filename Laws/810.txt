ROAD AUTHORITIES

 

(Jurisdiction)

 

      810.010 Jurisdiction over highways; exception. This section designates the bodies responsible for exercising jurisdiction over certain highways when the vehicle code requires the exercise of jurisdiction by the road authority. This section does not control where a specific section of the vehicle code specifically provides for exercising jurisdiction in a manner different than provided by this section. Except as otherwise specifically provided under the code, the responsibilities designated under this section do not include responsibility for maintenance. Responsibility for maintenance is as otherwise provided by law. The following are the road authorities for the described roads:

      (1) The Department of Transportation is the road authority for all state highways in this state including interstate highways.

      (2) The county governing body is the road authority for all county roads outside the boundaries of an incorporated city.

      (3) The governing body of an incorporated city is the road authority for all highways, roads, streets and alleys, other than state highways, within the boundaries of the incorporated city.

      (4) Any other municipal body, local board or local body is the road authority for highways, other than state highways, within its boundaries if the body or board has authority to adopt and administer local police regulations over the highway under the Constitution and laws of this state.

      (5) Any federal authority granted jurisdiction over federal lands within this state under federal law or rule is the road authority for highways on those lands as provided by the federal law or rule. [1983 c.338 §145; 1985 c.16 §45]

 

      810.012 Jurisdiction over access to facilities and services from certain roads; rules.

The restrictions or limitations are effective when appropriate signs giving notice of the restrictions or limitations are erected. A sign giving notice of a restriction or limitation in an order shall be maintained in a conspicuous manner and shall be placed at each end of the highway or section of highway affected by the order and at such other places as is necessary to inform the public.

      (4) Penalties are provided under ORS 818.130 for violation of restrictions imposed under this section. [1983 c.338 §147; 1985 c.16 §46]

      (5) Designate locations on highways where vehicles operated by districts described under ORS chapter 267 for the purpose of providing public transportation or substantially similar vehicles used for the same purpose may proceed in directions prohibited to other traffic.

(Parking)

 

      810.160 Controlling parking on highways; limitations. Except as otherwise provided in this section, each road authority has exclusive authority to regulate, control or prohibit the stopping, standing and parking of vehicles upon its own highways. The Oregon Transportation Commission shall act as road authority under this section in lieu of the Department of Transportation. The authority granted in this section is subject to all of the following:

      (1) The commission has exclusive authority to regulate, control or prohibit the stopping, standing and parking on all state highways:

      (a) Within the corporate limits of a city except where the highway is routed over a city street under ORS 373.010.

      (2) Road authorities other than the commission may permit angle parking on any highway where parking is subject to their jurisdiction under this section. For cities, this subsection includes authority to permit angle parking on any city street selected and designated as the route of a state highway under ORS 373.010 and, subject to the authority of the commission under this section, any state highway within the corporate limits of the city. This subsection does not allow any road authority to permit angle parking on a state highway if the commission determines that the highway is not of sufficient width to permit angle parking without interfering with the free movement of traffic.

      (3) All regulations, restrictions or prohibitions imposed by the commission under this section shall be by resolution or order entered in the commission’s official records.

      (4) Regulations, restrictions or prohibitions imposed by the commission under this section shall become effective and have the force of law when signs or markings giving notice thereof have been placed. To comply with this subsection, the commission shall place and maintain appropriate signs or markings at such places as may be necessary to inform the public and to give notice of all regulations, restrictions or prohibitions the commission establishes under this section.

      (5) Penalties are provided under ORS 811.575 for violation of restrictions placed on state highways under this section. [1983 c.338 §160]

The commission may identify access roads to winter recreation facilities, roadside plow-outs and other areas as winter recreation parking locations under this section. The commission shall designate winter recreation parking locations under this section after consultation with the Winter Recreation Advisory Committee established under ORS 802.350 and with land management agencies managing adjacent land.

      (2) The commission shall establish priorities for plowing the winter recreation parking locations established under this section. The commission shall establish priorities under this section after consultation with the Winter Recreation Advisory Committee established under ORS 802.350.

Snow removal provided for under this subsection may be performed by any of the following:

      (a) By the department itself.

(Speeds)

 

      810.180 Designation of maximum speeds; rules. (1) As used in this section:

      (a) “Designated speed” means the speed that is designated by a road authority as the maximum permissible speed for a highway and that may be different from the statutory speed for the highway.

      (b) “Statutory speed” means the speed that is established as a speed limit under ORS 811.111, or is established as the speed the exceeding of which is prima facie evidence of violation of the basic speed rule under ORS 811.105.

      (2)(a) A designated speed established under this section is a speed limit if the highway for which the speed is designated is subject to a statutory speed limit under ORS 811.111 that is in addition to the speed limit established under ORS 811.111 (1)(b).

      (b) A speed greater than a designated speed established under this section is prima facie evidence of violation of the basic speed rule if the designated speed is established for a highway on which there is no speed limit other than the limit established under ORS 811.111 (1)(b).

      (3) The Department of Transportation may establish by rule designated speeds on any specified section of interstate highway if the department determines that speed limits established under ORS 811.111 (1) are greater or less than is reasonable or safe under the conditions that exist with respect to that section of the interstate highway. Designated speeds established under this subsection are subject to all of the following:

      (a) The department may not establish a designated speed under this subsection of more than:

      (A) Sixty-five miles per hour for vehicles described in ORS 811.111 (1)(b); and
