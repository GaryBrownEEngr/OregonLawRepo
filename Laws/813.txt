      (2) The information about rights and consequences shall be substantially as follows:

      (a) Driving under the influence of intoxicants is a crime in Oregon, and the person is subject to criminal penalties if a test under ORS 813.100 shows that the person is under the influence of intoxicants. If the person refuses a test or fails, evidence of the refusal or failure may also be offered against the person.

      (b) The person will fail a test under ORS 813.100 for purposes of criminal penalties if the test discloses a blood alcohol content of 0.08 percent or more by weight. The person will fail a test for purposes of the Motorist Implied Consent Law if the test discloses a blood alcohol content of:

      (A) 0.08 percent or more by weight if the person was not driving a commercial motor vehicle;

      (B) 0.04 percent or more by weight if the person was driving a commercial motor vehicle; or

      (C) Any amount if the person was under 21 years of age.

      (c) If the person refuses or fails a test under ORS 813.100, the person’s driving privileges will be suspended.

      (g) After taking a test under ORS 813.100, the person will have a reasonable opportunity, upon request, for an additional chemical test for blood alcohol content to be performed at the person’s own expense by a qualified individual of the person’s choosing.

      (h) The person has a right to a hearing to challenge the validity of the suspension before the suspension becomes effective. The person must make a written request to the department for such a hearing. If the person wins at the hearing, the person’s driving privileges will not be suspended. If the person loses at the hearing, the suspension will remain in effect during any court review of the hearing.

      (i) If the person is issued a temporary driving permit under ORS 813.100, the information provided to the person shall include the number of hours before the driving permit will be effective and the number of days the permit will be effective.

      (3) If the person is driving a commercial motor vehicle, the information about rights and consequences shall include, in addition to the provisions of subsection (2) of this section, substantially the following:

      (a) If the person refuses a test under ORS 813.100 or submits to a breath or blood test and the level of alcohol in the person’s blood is 0.04 percent or more by weight, the person’s commercial driving privileges or right to apply for commercial driving privileges will be suspended and no hardship permit authorizing the person to drive a commercial motor vehicle will be issued. The suspension will be substantially longer if the person refuses a test.

      (b) The suspension of the person’s commercial driving privileges or right to apply for commercial driving privileges will be for the person’s lifetime if the person refuses a test under ORS 813.100 or submits to a breath or blood test and the level of alcohol in the person’s blood is 0.04 percent or more by weight and:

      (4) Nothing in this section prohibits the department from providing additional information concerning rights and consequences that the department considers convenient or appropriate. [1985 c.672 §22; 1987 c.673 §3; 1987 c.801 §11; 1989 c.171 §92; 1989 c.636 §43; 1991 c.185 §15; 1991 c.860 §10; 1993 c.305 §4; 1995 c.568 §4; 2003 c.814 §3; 2005 c.649 §28; 2009 c.607 §2; 2009 c.614 §2; 2013 c.237 §27]

      (a) The person takes the breath test described in ORS 813.100 and the test discloses a blood alcohol content of less than 0.08 percent; or

      (b) The person is involved in an accident resulting in injury or property damage. A urine test may be requested under this paragraph regardless of whether a breath test has been requested and regardless of the results of a breath test, if one is taken.

      (2) A police officer may not request a urine test unless the officer is certified by the Department of Public Safety Standards and Training as having completed at least eight hours of training in recognition of drug impaired driving and the officer has a reasonable suspicion that the person arrested has been driving while under the influence of cannabis, a controlled substance, an inhalant or any combination of cannabis, a controlled substance, an inhalant and intoxicating liquor.

      (3) A person asked to give a urine sample shall be given privacy and may not be observed by a police officer when producing the sample.

      (4)(a) At the trial of any civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding arising out of the acts committed by a person driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicants, a valid chemical analysis of a person’s urine is admissible as evidence and may be used with other evidence, if any, to determine whether the person was driving while under the influence of intoxicants.

      (b) A chemical analysis of a person’s urine is valid under this subsection if analysis is performed in an accredited or licensed toxicology laboratory. [1995 c.676 §1; 1999 c.619 §10; 1999 c.752 §1; 2009 c.325 §1; 2015 c.11 §1; 2017 c.21 §82]

 

      813.132 Consequences of refusing to take urine test; exception. (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a refusal to take a urine test requested under ORS 813.131 shall be treated for all purposes as a refusal to take a breath test.

      (2) Before any test of urine may be administered under ORS 813.131, in addition to information described in ORS 813.130, the person asked to take the test shall be informed that if the person refuses the test, the person’s driving privileges will be suspended for the same time period and with the same consequences as if the person had refused the breath test and that a suspension for refusal of the urine test will be consecutive to any other suspension under the Motorist Implied Consent Law.

      (3) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, no suspension of driving privileges shall be imposed for refusal to provide a urine sample if the person provides documentation from a physician licensed by this state showing that the person has a medical condition that makes it impossible for the person to provide a sample. [1995 c.676 §2; 1997 c.25 §3]

 

      813.135 Implied consent to field sobriety tests. Any person who operates a vehicle upon premises open to the public or the highways of the state shall be deemed to have given consent to submit to field sobriety tests upon the request of a police officer for the purpose of determining if the person is under the influence of intoxicants if the police officer reasonably suspects that the person has committed the offense of driving while under the influence of intoxicants in violation of ORS 813.010 or a municipal ordinance. Before the tests are administered, the person requested to take the tests shall be informed of the consequences of refusing to take or failing to submit to the tests under ORS 813.136. [1989 c.576 §15]

 

      813.136 Consequence of refusal or failure to submit to field sobriety tests. If a person refuses or fails to submit to field sobriety tests as required by ORS 813.135, evidence of the person’s refusal or failure to submit is admissible in any criminal or civil action or proceeding arising out of allegations that the person was driving while under the influence of intoxicants. [1989 c.576 §14]

 

CHEMICAL TESTS; METHODS AND REQUIREMENTS

 

      813.140 Chemical test with consent; unconscious person. Nothing in ORS 813.100 is intended to preclude the administration of a chemical test described in this section. A police officer may obtain a chemical test of the breath or blood to determine the amount of alcohol in any person’s blood or a test of the person’s blood or urine, or both, to determine the presence of cannabis, a controlled substance or an inhalant in the person as provided in the following:

      (1) If, when requested by a police officer, the person expressly consents to such a test.

      (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, from a person without the person’s consent if:

      (a) The police officer has probable cause to believe that the person was driving while under the influence of intoxicants and that evidence of the offense will be found in the person’s blood or urine; and

      (b) The person is unconscious or otherwise in a condition rendering the person incapable of expressly consenting to the test or tests requested. [1983 c.338 §593; 1985 c.16 §299; 1999 c.619 §11; 2013 c.642 §2; 2017 c.21 §83]

 

      813.150 Chemical test at request of arrested person.

The failure or inability to obtain such a test or tests by a person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to a test or tests taken upon the request of a police officer. [1983 c.338 §594; 1985 c.16 §300; 1999 c.619 §12; 2017 c.21 §84]

      (A) Approve methods of performing chemical analyses of a person’s breath.

      (B) Prepare manuals and conduct courses throughout the state for the training of police officers in chemical analyses of a person’s breath, which courses shall include, but are not limited to, approved methods of chemical analyses, use of approved equipment and interpretation of test results together with a written examination on these subjects.

      (C) Test and certify the accuracy of equipment to be used by police officers for chemical analyses of a person’s breath before regular use of the equipment and periodically thereafter at intervals of not more than 90 days. Tests and certification required by this subparagraph must be conducted by trained technicians. Certification under this subparagraph does not require a signed document.

      (D) Ascertain the qualifications and competence of individuals to conduct chemical analyses in accordance with one or more methods approved by the department.

      (E) Issue permits to individuals according to their qualifications. Permits may be issued to police officers only upon satisfactory completion of the prescribed training course and written examination.

      (2) In conducting a chemical test of the blood, only a duly licensed physician or a person acting under the direction or control of a duly licensed physician may withdraw blood or pierce human tissue. A licensed physician, or a qualified person acting under the direction or control of a duly licensed physician, is not civilly liable for withdrawing any bodily substance, in a medically acceptable manner, at the request of a peace officer.

      (3) An individual who performs a chemical analysis of breath or blood under ORS 813.100 or 813.140 shall prepare and sign a written report of the findings of the test that must include the identification of the police officer upon whose request the test was administered.

      (4) Any individual having custody of the report mentioned in subsection (3) of this section shall, upon request of the person tested, furnish that person or that person’s attorney, a copy of the report.

      (5) The expense of conducting a chemical test as provided by ORS 813.100 or 813.140 must be paid by the governmental unit on whose equipment the test is conducted or by the governmental unit upon whose request the test was administered if no governmental unit’s equipment is used to conduct the test. [1983 c.338 §173; 1985 c.16 §57; 1985 c.337 §2; 1995 c.351 §1; 2003 c.19 §1]

The defendant may also pay the balance of the fees owed before the day the hearing is held.

      (4) Before the court dismisses with prejudice a charge of driving while under the influence of intoxicants under this section, the court shall enter a judgment containing a money award, as defined in ORS 18.005, for any remaining amount of restitution owed by the defendant. [2013 c.78 §3]

 

      Note: 813.252 was added to and made a part of ORS chapter 813 by legislative action but was not added to any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      813.255 Termination of diversion. (1) At any time before the court dismisses with prejudice the charge of driving while under the influence of intoxicants, the court on its own motion or on the motion of the district attorney or city attorney may issue an order requiring the defendant to appear and show cause why the court should not terminate the diversion agreement. The order to show cause must:

      (a) State the reasons for the proposed termination;

      (b) Specify the amount of any fees owed and, if the amount owed is $500 or less, inform the defendant that the court may dismiss with prejudice the charge of driving while under the influence of intoxicants if the person has complied with and performed all of the conditions of the diversion agreement and pays the remaining amount before or on the date of the hearing; and

      (c) Set an appearance date.

      (2) The order to show cause shall be served on the defendant and on the defendant’s attorney, if any. Service may be made by first class mail, postage paid, addressed to the defendant at the mailing address shown on the diversion petition and agreement or at any other address that the defendant provides in writing to the court.

      (3) Except as provided in subsections (4), (5) and (6) of this section, the court shall terminate the diversion agreement and enter the guilty plea or no contest plea that was filed as part of the petition for the diversion agreement if the defendant fails to appear at the hearing on the order to show cause or if, at the hearing on the order to show cause, the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that:

      (a) The defendant no longer qualifies for the diversion agreement under the conditions described in ORS 813.215; or

      (b) The defendant failed to fulfill all of the terms of the diversion agreement.

      (4) If a defendant is a member of the Armed Forces of the United States, the reserve components of the Armed Forces of the United States or the National Guard and is on active duty, the court shall:

      (a) Allow the defendant to appear at the hearing by telephone or other communication device approved by the court, if the defendant’s military service permits such an appearance; or

      (b) Stay the termination proceeding if the defendant’s military service prohibits the defendant’s appearance by telephone or other communication device and prohibits the defendant from aiding and assisting the attorney who would appear on the defendant’s behalf.

      (5) If the defendant appears at the hearing on the order to show cause, the court shall dismiss with prejudice the charge of driving while under the influence of intoxicants if:

      (a) The defendant has complied with and performed all of the conditions of the diversion agreement except that the defendant owes $500 or less of the fees required under ORS 813.200, 813.210, 813.235 and 813.240; and

      (b) The defendant pays the balance of the fees owed by 5 p.m. on the day the hearing is held. The defendant may also pay the balance of the fees owed before the day the hearing is held.

      (6) A court may not terminate a diversion agreement under this section for failure to pay restitution under ORS 137.108 if the defendant has otherwise complied with and performed all of the conditions of the diversion agreement.

      (7) Before the court dismisses with prejudice the charge of driving while under the influence of intoxicants under this section, the court shall enter a judgment containing a money award, as defined in ORS 18.005, for any remaining amount of restitution owed by the defendant.

      (8) If the court terminates the diversion agreement and enters the guilty plea or no contest plea, the court may take into account at time of sentencing any partial fulfillment by the defendant of the terms of the diversion agreement. [1987 c.441 §9; 2003 c.816 §5; 2011 c.197 §3; 2013 c.78 §1]

 

      813.260 Designation of agencies to perform screening interviews; duties of agency. (1) Courts having jurisdiction over driving while under the influence of intoxicants offenses shall designate agencies or organizations to perform the screening interview and treatment required under driving while under the influence of intoxicants diversion agreements described in ORS 813.200. The designated agencies or organizations must meet minimum standards established pursuant to ORS 430.357 to perform the screening interview and treatment of problem drinking, alcoholism and drug dependency and must be certified by the Director of the Oregon Health Authority. Wherever possible a court shall designate agencies or organizations to perform the screening interview that are separate from those that may be designated to carry out a program of treatment.

      (2) Monitoring of a defendant’s progress under a diversion agreement shall be the responsibility of the agency or organization performing the screening interview. The agency or organization shall make a report to the court stating the defendant’s successful completion or failure to complete all or any part of the treatment program specified by the screening interview. The form of the report shall be determined by agreement between the court and the agency or organization performing the screening interview. The court shall make the report of the agency or organization performing the screening interview that is required by this subsection a part of the record of the case. [1983 c.338 §375; 1991 c.557 §7; 2009 c.595 §1144; 2011 c.673 §43; 2015 c.318 §54]

 

      813.270 Intoxicated Driver Program Fund; creation; uses. The Intoxicated Driver Program Fund is created to consist of moneys placed in the fund under ORS 813.030 and 813.240 or as otherwise provided by law and of gifts and grants made to the fund for carrying out the purposes of the fund. The moneys in the fund may be used only for the following purposes:

      (1) To pay for providing treatment for individuals who enter diversion agreements under ORS 813.200 and who are found to be indigent. Payment for treatment under this subsection may include treatment for problem drinking, alcoholism or drug dependency. Payment shall be made as provided by the Director of the Oregon Health Authority by rule to agencies or organizations providing treatment.

      (2) To pay for evaluation as provided by law of programs used for diversion agreements.

      (3) To pay the cost of administration of the fund by the Oregon Health Authority.

      (6) To pay for special services required to enable a person with a disability, or a person whose proficiency in the use of English is limited because of the person’s national origin, to participate in treatment programs that are used for diversion agreements under ORS 813.200 or are required under ORS 813.020. This subsection applies:

      (a) Whether or not the person is indigent; and

      (b) Only to special services required solely because of the person’s disability or limited proficiency in the use of English. [1983 c.338 §141; 1985 c.16 §42; 1989 c.576 §10; 1991 c.557 §8; 1993 c.757 §1; 1999 c.126 §6; 1999 c.646 §5a; 2007 c.70 §343; 2009 c.595 §1145; 2015 c.318 §55]

 

EVIDENCE

 

      813.300 Use of blood alcohol percentage as evidence; percentage required for being under the influence. (1) At the trial of any civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding arising out of the acts committed by a person driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicants, if the amount of alcohol in the person’s blood at the time alleged is less than 0.08 percent by weight of alcohol as shown by chemical analysis of the person’s breath or blood, it is indirect evidence that may be used with other evidence, if any, to determine whether or not the person was then under the influence of intoxicants.

      (2) Not less than 0.08 percent by weight of alcohol in a person’s blood constitutes being under the influence of intoxicating liquor.

      (3) Notwithstanding subsection (2) of this section, for purposes of the Motorist Implied Consent Law as defined in ORS 801.010, for a person who is under 21 years of age, any amount of alcohol in the blood constitutes being under the influence of intoxicating liquor.

      (4) Percent by weight of alcohol in the blood shall be based upon grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood or based upon grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. [1983 c.338 §590; 1985 c.16 §297; 1989 c.715 §7; 1991 c.860 §8; 2011 c.260 §1]

 

      813.310 Refusal to take chemical test admissible as evidence. If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test under ORS 813.100 or refuses to consent to chemical tests under ORS 813.140, evidence of the person’s refusal is admissible in any civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed while the person was driving a motor vehicle on premises open to the public or the highways while under the influence of intoxicants. [1983 c.338 §595; 1985 c.16 §301]

 

      813.320 Effect of implied consent law on evidence. (1) The provisions of the implied consent law, except ORS 813.300, shall not be construed by any court to limit the introduction of otherwise competent, relevant evidence in any civil action, suit or proceedings or in any criminal action other than a violation of ORS 813.010 or a similar municipal ordinance in proceedings under ORS 813.410.

      (2) The provisions of the implied consent law shall not be construed by any court to limit the introduction of otherwise competent, relevant evidence of the amount of alcohol in the blood of a defendant in a prosecution for driving while under the influence of intoxicants if:

      (a) The evidence results from a test of blood taken from the defendant while the defendant was hospitalized or otherwise receiving medical care, whether or not the defendant consented to the drawing of blood or to the test; or

      (b) The evidence is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. [1983 c.338 §596; 1985 c.16 §302; 1999 c.437 §1]

 

      813.322 Department of State Police rules regarding breath tests as evidence; validity of officer’s permit. (1) A court shall, at the request of a party to the case, admit into evidence, without certification, a copy of administrative rules of the Department of State Police addressing methods of conducting chemical tests of a person’s breath in a proceeding arising from the arrest of a person for driving while under the influence of intoxicants.

      (2) If a police officer testifies in a proceeding arising from the arrest of a person for driving while under the influence of intoxicants that the officer has a valid permit to perform analysis of a person’s breath, the defendant has the burden of moving forward with evidence to show that the officer does not have a valid permit. [1999 c.446 §2]

 

      Note: 813.322 was added to and made a part of the Oregon Vehicle Code by legislative action but was not added to ORS chapter 813 or any series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      813.324 Use of testimony from implied consent hearing as evidence in prosecution. (1) If the prosecuting attorney or the attorney for the defendant in a prosecution for driving while under the influence of intoxicants obtains a tape or a transcript of a hearing held for the defendant under ORS 813.410, the attorney must provide a copy of the tape or transcript to the attorney for the other party at least seven days prior to the first date set for trial. If the attorney fails to supply the material in the time required, testimony from the hearing may not be admitted in evidence in the trial for any purpose, unless the attorney shows good cause for the failure to make the material available.

      (2) The cost of a copy of a tape or transcript furnished under subsection (1) of this section shall be borne by the party who receives the copy.

      (3) Nothing in this section requires a tape to be transcribed by the attorney who is required to provide a tape or transcript under subsection (1) of this section. [1999 c.831 §3]

 

      Note: 813.324 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of the Oregon Vehicle Code or any chapter or series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      813.326 Felony driving while under the influence of intoxicants; prior convictions. (1) In a prosecution for felony driving while under the influence of intoxicants under ORS 813.010, the state shall plead the prior convictions and shall prove the prior convictions unless the defendant stipulates to that fact prior to trial. If the defendant so stipulates and the trial is by jury:

      (a) The court shall accept the stipulation regardless of whether or not the state agrees to it;

      (b) The defendant’s stipulation to the prior convictions constitutes a judicial admission to that element of the accusatory instrument. The stipulation shall be made a part of the record of the case, but shall not be offered or received in the presence of the jury;

      (c) For the purpose of establishing the prior convictions solely as an element of the crime under ORS 813.010, neither the court nor the state shall reveal to the jury the prior convictions, but the prior convictions are established in the record by the defendant’s stipulation; and

      (d) The court shall not submit the accusatory instrument or evidence of the prior convictions to the jury.

      (2) In a proceeding under ORS 813.010, the state may offer, and the court may receive and submit to the jury, evidence of the prior convictions for impeachment of the defendant or another purpose, other than establishing the prior convictions as an element of the offense, when the evidence of the prior convictions is otherwise admissible for that purpose. When evidence of the prior convictions has been admitted by the court, the state may comment upon, and the court may give instructions about, the evidence of the prior convictions only to the extent that the comments or instructions relate to the purpose for which the evidence was admitted.

      (3) When the defendant stipulates to the prior convictions required as an element of felony driving while under the influence of intoxicants under ORS 813.010, if the jury finds the defendant guilty upon instruction regarding the balance of the elements of the crime, the court shall enter a judgment of guilty of felony driving while under the influence of intoxicants.

      (4) As used in this section, “conviction” includes a juvenile adjudication. [1999 c.1049 §5; 2009 c.525 §2]

 

      Note: 813.326 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of the Oregon Vehicle Code or any chapter or series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      813.328 Notice of intent to challenge validity of prior convictions. (1) A defendant who challenges the validity of prior convictions alleged by the state as an element of felony driving while under the influence of intoxicants must give notice of the intent to challenge the validity of the prior convictions at least seven days prior to the first date set for trial on the felony charge. The validity of the prior convictions shall be determined prior to trial by the court.

      (2) As used in this section, “conviction” includes a juvenile adjudication. [1999 c.1049 §4; 2009 c.525 §3]

A suspension of driving privileges imposed under this subsection shall be for a period of time established under ORS 813.420.

      (2) If the department receives from a police officer a report pursuant to ORS 813.120 and the person holds commercial driving privileges and the person was driving a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle and refused to submit to a test under ORS 813.100 or the person was driving a commercial motor vehicle and submitted to a breath or blood test and the person’s blood, as shown by the test, had 0.04 percent or more by weight of alcohol, the department shall suspend the person’s commercial driving privileges on the 30th day after the date of arrest or, if the report indicates that the person failed a blood test, on the 60th day after receipt of the report, unless, at a hearing described under this section, the department determines that the suspension would not be valid as described in this section. A commercial driving privileges suspension imposed under this subsection shall be for a period of time established under ORS 809.510 or 809.520.

      (3) If within 10 days from the date of arrest, or, if the person fails a blood test, within 10 days from the date the department sends notice of suspension, the department receives a written request for a hearing from a person whose driving privileges or commercial driving privileges the department proposes to suspend under this section, the department shall provide a hearing in accordance with this section. Except as otherwise provided under this section, a hearing held by the department under this section shall be subject to the provisions for contested cases, other than appeal provisions, under ORS chapter 183. The applicable appeal provisions are as provided under ORS 813.450 and section 24, chapter 672, Oregon Laws 1985. Notwithstanding ORS 809.430, the department is not required to give any notice of intent to suspend or suspension in addition to that provided under ORS 813.100.

      (4) Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, a hearing required by this section is subject to all of the following:

      (a) The hearing shall be conducted by an administrative law judge assigned from the Office of Administrative Hearings established under ORS 183.605.

      (b) The administrative law judge shall conduct the hearing by telephone or other two-way electronic communication device.

      (c) The department may authorize the administrative law judge to issue a final order in any case.

      (d) A person who requests a hearing under this section and who fails, without just cause, to appear personally or through an attorney waives the right to a hearing. If a person waives a right to a hearing under this paragraph, the department is not required to make any showing at hearing.

      (e) Except as provided in ORS 813.440 or upon remand under ORS 813.450, the department shall hold the hearing and issue a final order within 30 days of the date of the arrest or, if the person fails a blood test, within 60 days from the date the department received the report of the failure.

      (f) In connection with the hearing, the department or its authorized representative may administer oaths and shall issue subpoenas for the appearance of witnesses by telephone or other two-way electronic communication device at the hearing requested by the person or the department and the production of relevant documents.

      (d) In connection with the hearing, the department or its authorized representative may administer oaths and shall issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses at the hearing requested under this subsection by the person and the production of relevant documents.

      (6) This subsection shall be narrowly construed so as to effect the legislative purpose of limiting the scope of hearings under this section. The scope of a hearing under this section shall be limited to whether the suspension is valid as described in this subsection. A suspension under this section is valid if all of the following requirements have been met:

      (a) The person, at the time the person was requested to submit to a test under ORS 813.100, was under arrest for driving while under the influence of intoxicants in violation of ORS 813.010 or a municipal ordinance.

      (B) 0.04 percent or more by weight if the person was driving a commercial motor vehicle; or

      (C) Any amount if the person was under 21 years of age.

      (e) The person had been informed under ORS 813.100 of rights and consequences as described under ORS 813.130.

      (f) The person was given written notice required under ORS 813.100.

      (h) If the person arrested submitted to a test under ORS 813.100, the methods, procedures and equipment used in the test complied with requirements under ORS 813.160.

      (7) A suspension imposed under this section shall remain in effect pending any appeal or remand of a final order issued under this section and there shall be no stay of the suspension pending appeal or remand.

      (8) Unless a person fails, without just cause, to appear personally or through an attorney at a hearing requested under this section, a person shall have the right to appeal any final order by the department after a hearing under this section by filing a petition.

      (b) The court upon receipt of the petition shall set the matter for hearing upon 10 days’ notice to the department and the petitioner unless hearing is waived by both the department and the petitioner. [1983 c.338 §358; 1985 c.16 §167; 1985 c.672 §13; 1987 c.158 §170; 1989 c.636 §44; 1991 c.860 §11; 1993 c.305 §6; 1993 c.600 §1; 1995 c.568 §6; 1999 c.831 §2; 1999 c.849 §§193,194; 2003 c.75 §67; 2005 c.649 §27; 2007 c.288 §18; 2010 c.37 §1; 2013 c.237 §29]

 

      813.412 Role of police officer in implied consent hearing. Notwithstanding ORS 9.160 and 9.320, in any hearing under ORS 813.410 in which a city attorney or district attorney does not appear, a police officer actively involved in the investigation of the offense may present evidence, examine and cross-examine witnesses and make arguments relating to:

      (1) The application of statutes and rules to the facts in the case;

      (2) The literal meaning of the statutes or rules at issue in the case;

      (3) The admissibility of evidence; and

      (4) Proper procedures to be used in the hearing. [1999 c.831 §4; 2010 c.37 §2]

 

      Note: 813.412 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of the Oregon Vehicle Code or any chapter or series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      813.420 Duration of suspension for refusal or failure of test. When the Department of Transportation imposes a suspension under ORS 813.410, the suspension shall be for a period of time determined according to the following:

      (1) If the suspension is for refusal of a test under ORS 813.100 and the person is not subject to an increase in the suspension time for reasons described in ORS 813.430, the suspension shall be for a period of one year.

      (2) If the suspension is for refusal of a test under ORS 813.100 and the person is subject to an increase in the suspension time for reasons described in ORS 813.430, the suspension shall be for a period of three years.

      (3) If the suspension is because a breath or blood test under ORS 813.100 disclosed that the person had a level of alcohol in the person’s blood that constituted being under the influence of intoxicating liquor under ORS 813.300 and the person is not subject to an increase in the suspension time for reasons described in ORS 813.430, the suspension shall be for a period of 90 days.

      (4) If the suspension is because a breath or blood test under ORS 813.100 disclosed that the person had a level of alcohol in the person’s blood that constituted being under the influence of intoxicating liquor under ORS 813.300 and the person is subject to an increase in the suspension time for reasons described in ORS 813.430, the suspension shall be for a period of one year. [1985 c.16 §171; 1993 c.305 §7; 1995 c.568 §7]

 

      813.430 Grounds for increase in duration of suspension. This section establishes circumstances under which ORS 813.420 requires an increase in the time for suspension of driving privileges and under which ORS 813.520 requires an increase in the time before the Department of Transportation may issue a hardship permit. A person is subject to an increase in suspension time under this section if any of the following apply:

      (1) The person is presently participating in a driving while under the influence of intoxicants diversion program in this state or in any similar alcohol or drug rehabilitation program in this or another jurisdiction.

      (2) Within the five years preceding the date of arrest any of the following occurred:

      (a) A suspension of the person’s driving privileges under ORS 813.410 or 482.540 (1981 Replacement Part) became effective.

      (b) The person was convicted of:

      (A) Driving while under the influence of intoxicants in violation of:

      (i) ORS 813.010;

      (ii) The statutory counterpart to ORS 813.010 in another jurisdiction; or

      (iii) A municipal ordinance in this state or another jurisdiction;

      (C) A driving offense in another jurisdiction that involved operating a vehicle while having a blood alcohol content above that jurisdiction’s permissible blood alcohol content.

      (c) The person commenced participating in a driving while under the influence of intoxicants diversion program in this state or in any similar alcohol or drug rehabilitation program in this or another jurisdiction.

      (3) For the purposes of subsection (2)(b) of this section, a conviction for a driving offense in another jurisdiction based solely on a person under 21 years of age having a blood alcohol content that is lower than the permissible blood alcohol content in that jurisdiction for a person 21 years of age or older does not constitute a prior conviction. [1985 c.16 §173; 1985 c.672 §15; 1987 c.801 §12; 2007 c.879 §8; 2017 c.21 §87]

 

      813.440 Grounds for hearing on validity of suspension; rules. (1) Notwithstanding ORS 813.410, the Department of Transportation may provide a hearing to determine the validity of a suspension under ORS 813.410 only if the time requirements under ORS 813.410 could not be met because of any of the following:

      (a) The person’s physical incapacity, verified by a physician to the satisfaction of the department to be of a nature that would prevent the person from making the appropriate request or attending the hearing.

      (b) A death in the immediate family of the person, verified to the satisfaction of the department.

      (c) An error of the department.

      (d) The inability of a subpoenaed police officer to appear due to the officer’s illness, vacation or official duty conflicts. The department shall set forth by rule the conditions that constitute “official duty conflicts.” A hearing may not be rescheduled more than once for reasons described in this paragraph.

      (e) A request for a change of administrative law judge under ORS 183.645.

      (f) The inability of the person’s attorney to appear due to the attorney’s illness, vacation or scheduling conflict arising from other court or administrative hearing appearances. A hearing must be rescheduled no later than 45 days after the date of the original hearing and may not be rescheduled more than once for reasons described in this paragraph.

      (g) Other just cause as defined by the department by administrative rule.

      (2) A hearing held under this section is subject to the same provisions as a hearing held under ORS 813.410, except that the department is not required to hold the hearing and make the determination within the time required by ORS 813.410.

      (3) The granting of a hearing under this section shall not delay the imposition of a suspension under ORS 813.410 within the time required under ORS 813.410. However, if a person establishes that the person was deprived by either department error or a subpoenaed police officer’s illness, vacation or official duty conflicts of an opportunity to appear at a hearing, the department shall rescind the suspension and shall promptly schedule a subsequent hearing to determine the validity of the suspension under ORS 813.410. In other cases under this section, when the department is unable to hold the hearing within the time required by ORS 813.410, the department shall rescind any suspension imposed under ORS 813.410 only if the department determines, at a hearing held under this section, that the suspension was not valid as described under ORS 813.410.

      (4) The following apply to this section:

      (a) The department shall issue a final order within 10 days after the hearing described in this section.

      (b) If the department has rescinded a suspension under subsection (3) of this section and if the department, at the hearing described in this section, determines that the suspension is valid as described under ORS 813.410, the department shall reinstate the suspension effective five days after the final order is issued.

      (c) Notwithstanding ORS 809.430, no additional notice or order of suspension need be given. [1985 c.16 §169; 1985 c.672 §14; 1987 c.272 §5; 1993 c.600 §2; 1999 c.831 §1; 2001 c.294 §§9,10; 2003 c.75 §68; 2009 c.520 §1]

 

      813.450 Appeal from suspension for refusal or failure of breath test. (1) The petition to the circuit court appealing an order of the Department of Transportation after a hearing under ORS 813.410 shall state the nature of the petitioner’s interest and the ground or grounds upon which the petitioner contends the order should be reversed or remanded.

      (2) The court shall conduct the review without a jury. Review shall be limited to the record of the department’s hearing.

      (3) Any party to the proceedings before the circuit court may appeal from the judgment of the court to the Court of Appeals.

      (4) Upon review in the circuit court and Court of Appeals, the court may affirm, reverse or remand the order as follows:

      (a) If the court finds that the department has erroneously interpreted a provision of law and that a correct interpretation compels a particular action, it shall:

      (A) Set aside or modify the order; or

      (B) Remand the case to the department for further action under a correct interpretation of the provision of law.

      (b) The court shall remand the order to the department if it finds the department’s exercise of discretion to be any of the following:

      (A) Outside the range of discretion delegated to the agency by law.

      (B) Inconsistent with a department rule, an officially stated department position, or a prior department practice, if the inconsistency is not explained by the department.

      (C) Otherwise in violation of a constitutional or statutory provision.

      (c) The court shall set aside or remand the order if it finds that the order is not supported by substantial evidence in the record.

      (5) Upon review, the court shall affirm the department’s order unless the court finds a ground for setting aside, modifying or remanding to the department under a specified provision of this section.

      (6) In any review under this section, the court shall also review de novo determinations made by an agency that are subject to ORS 183.650 (4). [1985 c.672 §23; 1999 c.849 §§196,197; 2003 c.75 §69]

 

      813.460 Department procedures upon verification of suspension of driving privileges of wrong person. If the Department of Transportation verifies to its satisfaction that it has suspended the driving privileges of the wrong person under ORS 813.410 because a person arrested for driving under the influence of intoxicants gave false identification at the time of the arrest, all the following apply:

      (1) The department shall immediately rescind the suspension order under the false name and shall issue a suspension order for the period set forth in ORS 813.420 to the person arrested.

      (2) The department shall issue the order in the manner set forth in ORS 809.430.

      (3) No further notice of suspension need be given.

      (4) The time limitations in ORS 813.410 (1), (2), (3) and (4)(e) do not apply to a suspension order issued under this section. [1985 c.672 §25; 1989 c.636 §47]

 

      813.470 Department notation on record of person acquitted after suspension. The Department of Transportation shall make a notation on the driving record of a person indicating that the person was acquitted of a charge of driving under the influence of intoxicants if:

      (1) The person’s driving privileges were suspended because a breath or blood test under ORS 813.100 disclosed that the person had a level of alcohol in the person’s blood that constituted being under the influence of intoxicating liquor under ORS 813.300;

      (2) An accusatory instrument was filed charging the person with driving under the influence of intoxicants in violation of ORS 813.010 arising out of the same incident that led to the suspension of the person’s driving privileges;

      (3) The person was acquitted of the charge; and

      (4) The person presents the department with a certified copy of the judgment of acquittal from the court clearly showing the location of the court, the date of the arrest and the findings of the court. [1987 c.303 §2; 1993 c.305 §8; 1995 c.568 §8]

      (3) The person may use the hardship permit to get to or from a gambling addiction treatment program, in addition to the places listed in subsection (2) of this section.

      (4) If the authority determines that the person does not have a problem condition involving alcohol, cannabis, controlled substances or inhalants as described in ORS 813.040, the department may issue the permit to the person only if, in addition to any requirements under ORS 807.240, the person enters an alcohol or drug information program approved by the authority and the department determines that issuance of a permit is appropriate. If the department issues a permit to a person described in this subsection, the department shall require, under ORS 807.240, that the person complete the program as a condition of retaining the permit. [1983 c.338 §328; 1985 c.16 §145; 1987 c.801 §13; 1989 c.401 §2; 1991 c.557 §9; 1999 c.619 §13; 2003 c.23 §4; 2009 c.595 §1146; 2017 c.21 §88; 2017 c.319 §4]

This section establishes limitations that the Department of Transportation is required or permitted to place on hardship permits issued under ORS 807.240 to persons whose suspension is based upon a conviction for driving under the influence of intoxicants or upon ORS 813.100. Limitations placed on a hardship permit under this section are in addition to any limitations placed on the permit under ORS 807.240. A person’s permit is subject to suspension or revocation as provided under ORS 807.240 if the department determines that the holder of the permit has violated any limitation placed upon the permit under this section. Violation of a limitation under this section is punishable as provided by ORS 811.175 or 811.182. The limitations are as described in the following:

      (1) A hardship permit issued to the person shall limit the person’s driving privileges:

      (a) To the times, places, routes and days the department determines to be minimally necessary for the person to seek or retain employment, to attend any gambling addiction, alcohol or drug treatment or rehabilitation program or to obtain required medical treatment for the person or a member of the person’s immediate family; and

      (b) To times, places, routes and days that are specifically stated.

This period of 90 days shall be reduced by the time the department refused to issue a hardship permit under subsection (5) or (6) of this section if the person’s driving privileges were suspended based on the same occurrence.

      (2) For a period of 30 days after the beginning of the suspension if the suspension is because a breath or blood test under ORS 813.100 disclosed that the person had a level of alcohol in the person’s blood that constituted being under the influence of intoxicating liquor under ORS 813.300 and the person is not subject to an increase in the time before a hardship permit may be issued for reasons described in ORS 813.430. This period of 30 days shall be reduced by the time the department refused to issue a hardship permit under subsection (5) or (6) of this section if the person’s driving privileges were suspended based on the same occurrence.

      (3) For a period of one year after the beginning of the suspension if the suspension is because a breath or blood test under ORS 813.100 disclosed that the person had a level of alcohol in the person’s blood that constituted being under the influence of intoxicating liquor under ORS 813.300 and the person is subject to an increase in the time before a hardship permit may be issued for reasons described under ORS 813.430.

      (5) For a period of 90 days after the beginning of the suspension under ORS 813.400 if it is the person’s second conviction for driving while under the influence of intoxicants if the suspension period is determined by ORS 809.428 (2)(b). This period of 90 days shall be reduced by the time the department refused to issue a hardship permit under subsection (1), (2), (3) or (4) of this section if the person’s driving privileges were suspended based on the same occurrence.

      (6) For a period of one year after the beginning of the suspension under ORS 813.400 for driving while under the influence of intoxicants if the suspension period is determined by ORS 809.428 (2)(c). This period of one year shall be reduced by the time the department refused to issue a hardship permit under subsection (1), (2), (3) or (4) of this section if the person’s driving privileges were suspended based on the same occurrence.

      (7) To any person who has a mental or physical condition or impairment that affects the person’s ability to safely operate a motor vehicle.

      (8) If the suspension is based upon a conviction for a violation of ORS 813.010 or is imposed under ORS 813.410 based upon ORS 813.100 to a person who has available public or private transportation sufficient to fulfill the person’s transportation needs while the person is suspended.

      (9) For a period of 30 days following imposition of suspension, if the person, within the previous year, has been convicted of a traffic crime and the suspension is based upon a conviction for violation of ORS 813.010 or is imposed under ORS 813.410 based upon ORS 813.100.
