WEIGHT

 

      818.010 Maximum allowable weight. This section establishes maximum weight limitations for purposes of ORS 818.020. Except as provided in subsections (4) and (5) of this section or where an exemption under ORS 818.030 specifically provides otherwise, a loaded weight that exceeds the maximum allowable weight as determined by any of the following tables exceeds the maximum weight limitations for purposes of ORS 818.020:

      (1) A vehicle exceeds the maximum allowable weight if the loaded weight of an axle or tandem axle is in excess of that determined by the formula in the following table:

 

 

Table I

      The manufacturer’s side wall tire rating (but not to exceed 600 pounds) ´ the sum of the tire widths, in inches, of the wheels of the axle or tandem axles = maximum allowable weight.

 

 

For purposes of the table in this subsection tire width is determined by measuring the cross section of the tread of a wheel, the outer face of a track or the runner of a sled except for the following:

      (a) For solid tires made of elastic material, tire width is determined by measuring the cross section between the flanges of the circumference of a wheel at the base of the tire as customarily measured and rated by the manufacturers of motor vehicles and tires.

      (b) For pneumatic tires made of elastic material, tire width is the diameter of the cross section of the tire as customarily measured and rated by the manufacturers of motor vehicles and tires.

      (2) A vehicle or combination of vehicles exceeds the maximum allowable weight if the loaded weight measured at any of the places designated on the following table exceeds the maximum allowable weight established on the table for measurement at that place:

 

 

Table II

 

Place for measurement                       Maximum allowable

of weight                                             weight in pounds

      Any individual wheel                            10,000

      Any axle                                                20,000

      Any tandem axles                                  34,000

 

 

      (3) A vehicle, group of axles or combination of vehicles exceeds the maximum allowable weight if the loaded weight is in excess of maximum allowable weight as determined by the method in the following table that produces the lower allowable maximum weight:

 

 

Table III

(Maximum allowable weight

determined by whichever of the

following methods produces lower weight:)

Method A

      The sum of permissible axle, tandem axles or group of axles weights as determined under Table I or II of this section is the maximum allowable weight.

      818.220 Requirements, conditions and procedures for issuance of variance permit; duration; cancellation; rules. This section establishes requirements, conditions and procedures for issuance of variance permits under ORS 818.200 as follows:

      (1) In issuing a permit, the road authority may:

      (a) Grant a permit that is valid for a single trip, a number of trips or continuous operation.

      (b) Establish seasonal or other time limitations on a permit.

      (c) Establish any additional terms, limits or conditions on a permit that are necessary or desirable for the protection of the highways and streets and the public interest.

      (d) Require the applicant to furnish public liability and property damage insurance in an amount fixed by the granting authority.

      (e) Require the applicant to furnish indemnity insurance or an indemnity bond, in an amount fixed by the granting authority, to:

      (A) Indemnify the road authority for any damage to the highways or streets that may be caused under the permit; and

      (B) Indemnify the members, officers, employees and agents of the road authority from any claim that might arise out of the granting of the permit and the use of the highways under the permit.

      (f) Require a demonstration by the applicant to establish that operation under a permit would:

      (A) Stay on the right side of the center line of the traveled way at all times; and

      (B) Allow sufficient room in the opposing traffic lane for the safe movement of other vehicles.

      (2) A permit shall be in writing and shall specify:

      (a) All highways or streets over which the permit is valid.

      (b) Any vehicle, combination of vehicles, load, article, property, machine or thing allowed under the permit.

      (c) Maximum dimensions and maximum weights allowed under the permit.

      (3) A road authority may not issue a permit under this section:

      (a) That is valid for longer than one year.

      (b) Until any insurance or bond required under this section is filed with and accepted by the granting authority.

      (c) Until the granting authority has investigated any representations made in the application for the permit.

      (d) If the sole purpose of the permit is to specify highways on which a vehicle or combination of vehicles may not travel.

      (4) An application for a permit issued under this section shall be in writing and shall specify:

      (a) The vehicle, combination of vehicles, load, article, property, machine or thing for which the permit is requested;

      (b) The particular highways and streets for which the permit is sought; and

      (c) Whether the permit is sought for a single trip, number of trips or continuous operation.

      (5) This section does not authorize:

      (a) Except as specified in a permit, any vehicle, combination of vehicles, load, article, property, machine or thing for which the permit is issued to be operated or moved contrary to any provisions of the vehicle code.

      (b) Any movement or operation of a vehicle, combination of vehicles, load, article, property, machine or thing until a permit is issued.

      (6) The road authority may appoint any of its officers, employees or agents to be present at and during the movement. The presence of any person so appointed and any interference or suggestion made by that person shall not be considered supervision of the movement and shall not relieve the permit holder, or the permit holder’s insurers or sureties, from liability for any damage done by the movement. If, in the opinion of the person appointed to be present at and during the movement, any of the terms and conditions of the permit are not being complied with, that person may order the movement to be stopped.

      (7) Any permit may be canceled at any time by the road authority upon proof satisfactory to it that:

      (a) The permit holder has violated any of the terms of the permit;

      (b) The permit was obtained through misrepresentation in the application therefor; or

      (c) The public interest requires cancellation.

      (8) A road authority may establish a program for issuance of permits that is not subject to any requirements, conditions or procedures described under this section. A program established under this subsection shall be established by rule or resolution, as appropriate. A program established under this subsection may include any of the following:

      (a) Provisions and requirements that differ from those otherwise required under this section.

      (b) Authority that is not subject to the limitations under ORS 818.210.

      (c) Any provisions or requirements the road authority determines may simplify or expedite the process of issuing permits.

      (d) Exclusions from the prohibitions and penalties under ORS 818.350 if the person or vehicle complies with the conditions of the permit and the program.

      (e) Applicability of the penalties provided under ORS 818.340, 818.350 and 818.410 for violation of the program.

      (9) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if a road authority other than the state issues a variance permit for a divisible load with a combined weight of more than 80,000 pounds, the variance permit shall be a one-year permit that is valid for continuous operation.

      (10) The Department of Transportation may adopt rules to establish uniform requirements and consistent mitigation strategies that a road authority must apply as conditions for operation of a truck tractor and semitrailer combination under an overlength variance permit issued under ORS 818.200.

      (2)(a) In addition to any fee for a single-trip nondivisible load permit, a person who is issued the permit or who operates a vehicle in a manner that requires the permit is liable for payment of a road use assessment fee computed on the basis of the following rates per equivalent single-axle load mile traveled:

      (A) For the period beginning on January 1, 2018, and ending on December 31, 2019, eight and five-tenths cents.

      (B) For the period beginning on January 1, 2020, and ending on December 31, 2021, nine and three-tenths cents.

      (C) For the period beginning on January 1, 2022, and ending on December 31, 2023, ten and three-tenths cents.

      (b) If the road use assessment fee is not collected at the time of issuance of the permit, the department shall bill the permittee for the amount due. The account shall be considered delinquent if not paid within 60 days of billing.

      (c) The miles of travel authorized by a single-trip nondivisible load permit shall be exempt from taxation under ORS chapter 825.
