      (4) Any compromises, agreements, admissions, stipulations, statements of fact or other such action taken by the representative at any such proceeding is binding on those represented to the same extent as if done by an attorney. A person so represented may not thereafter claim that any such proceeding was legally defective because the person was not represented by an attorney.

Binding rulings provided by this section are subject to review in the Court of Appeals in the manner provided in ORS 183.480 for the review of orders in contested cases. [1995 c.733 §34]

      (4) Any forfeiture or penalty provided for in any law regarding motor carriers or railroads administered by the department shall be recovered by an action brought thereon in the name of the State of Oregon in any court of appropriate jurisdiction or as provided in ORS 183.745. [1995 c.733 §25; 2011 c.506 §52; 2013 c.180 §58]

 

      823.083 Enjoining violation of carrier laws. (1) Whenever it appears to the Department of Transportation that any motor carrier, railroad or any other person subject to the jurisdiction of the department is engaged or about to engage in any acts or practices that constitute a violation of any statute regarding motor carriers or railroads administered by the department, or any rule, regulation, requirement, order, term or condition issued thereunder, the department may apply to any circuit court of the state where such motor carrier, railroad or any other person subject to the jurisdiction of the department operates for the enforcement of such statute, rule, regulation, requirement, order, term or condition.

      (2) Such court, without bond, has jurisdiction to enforce obedience thereto by injunction, or by other processes, mandatory or otherwise, restraining such motor carrier, railroad or any other person subject to the jurisdiction of the department, or its officers, agents, employees and representatives from further violations of such statute, rule, regulation, requirement, order, term or condition, and enjoining upon them obedience thereto.

      (3) The provisions of this section are in addition to and not in lieu of any other enforcement provisions contained in any statute administered by the department. [1995 c.733 §26]

If the party seeking damages alleges and proves that the wrong or omission was the result of gross negligence or willful misconduct, the motor carrier or railroad is liable to the person injured thereby in treble the amount of damages sustained in consequence of the violation. The court may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party in an action under this section.

      (2) Any recovery under this section does not affect recovery by the state of the penalty, forfeiture or fine prescribed for such violation.

      (3) This section does not apply with respect to the liability of any motor carrier or railroad for personal injury or property damage. [1995 c.733 §§27,99; 1997 c.249 §239]

 

      823.087 Effect of carrier laws on common law and other statutory rights of action, duties and liabilities. (1) The remedies and enforcement procedures provided in ORS chapters 823, 824, 825 and 826 do not release or waive any right of action by the state or by any person for any right, penalty or forfeiture that may arise under any law of this state or under an ordinance of any municipality thereof.

      (2) All penalties and forfeitures accruing under said statutes and ordinances are cumulative and a suit for and recovery of one, shall not be a bar to the recovery of any other penalty.

      (3) The duties and liabilities of the motor carriers or railroads shall be the same as are prescribed by the common law, and the remedies against them the same, except where otherwise provided by the Constitution or statutes of this state, and the provisions of ORS chapters 823, 824, 825 and 826 are cumulative thereto.

RECEIPTS AND BILLS OF LADING

 

      823.101 Duty of carrier to issue bill of lading on intrastate shipments; liability of carrier to holder for damage to shipment. (1) Any for-hire carrier, railroad or transportation company receiving property for transportation wholly within this state, from one point in this state to another point in this state, shall issue in accordance with the applicable provisions of ORS chapter 77 a receipt or bill of lading therefor, and shall be liable to the lawful holder thereof for any loss, damage or injury to such property caused by it, or by any common carrier to which such property may be delivered, or over whose line or lines such property may pass, when transported on a through bill of lading. No contract, receipt, rule, regulation or other limitation of any character whatsoever shall exempt such for-hire carrier, railroad or transportation company from such liability.

      (2) Any for-hire carrier, railroad or transportation company so receiving property for transportation wholly within this state shall be liable to the lawful holder of such receipt or bill of lading, or to any party entitled to recover thereon, whether such receipt or bill of lading has been issued or not, for the full actual loss, damage or injury to such property caused by it, or by any common carrier to which such property may be delivered, or over whose line such property may pass when transported on a through bill of lading, notwithstanding any limitation of liability or limitation of the amount of recovery, or representation or agreement as to value in any such receipt or bill of lading, or in any contract, rule or regulation, or in any tariff filed with the Department of Transportation; and any such limitation, irrespective of the manner or form in which it is sought to be made, is unlawful and void.

      (3) The provisions of subsection (2) of this section respecting liability for full actual loss, damage or injury, shall not apply:

      (a) To baggage carried on passenger trains or boats, or trains or boats carrying passengers.

      (b) To property, except ordinary livestock, concerning which the carrier is expressly authorized or required by order of the Department of Transportation to establish and maintain rates dependent upon the value declared in writing by the shipper or agreed upon in writing as the released value of the property. “Ordinary livestock” includes all cattle, swine, sheep, goats, horses and mules, except such as are chiefly used for breeding, racing, show purposes or other special uses.

      (4) The Department of Transportation may make the order referred to in subsection (3)(b) of this section in cases where rates dependent upon and varying with declared or agreed values would, in the opinion of the department, be just and reasonable under the circumstances and conditions surrounding the transportation. Any tariff schedule filed with the department pursuant to such order shall contain specific reference thereto and may establish rates varying with the value so declared and agreed upon. [Formerly 771.010; 1997 c.249 §241]

 

      823.103 Limitations on carrier’s power to set time for filing of claim or starting action. A for-hire carrier, railroad or transportation company referred to in ORS 823.101 may not provide by rule, contract, regulation or otherwise a period for filing claims described in ORS 823.101 shorter than the following:

      (1) Nine months after delivery of property or after reasonable time for delivery has elapsed for filing of claims in writing, except that if the carrier is a for-hire carrier of household goods, three months.

      (2) Two years for the institution of suits. The period for institution of suits shall be computed from the day when notice is given by the carrier to the claimant that the carrier has disallowed all or any part of the claim specified in the notice. [Formerly 771.020; 1997 c.249 §242; 2003 c.754 §12]

 

      823.105 Prohibitions. No common carrier subject to ORS 823.101 to 823.107, its director or officer, receiver, trustee, lessee, agent or person acting for or employed by it, shall, alone or with any other person, willfully do or cause to be done, or willingly suffer or permit to be done, any act, matter or thing prohibited or declared to be unlawful in ORS 823.101 to 823.107, or aid or abet therein, or willfully omit or fail to do any act, matter or thing required to be done by ORS 823.101 to 823.107 or cause or willingly suffer or permit any act, matter or thing so directed or required by ORS 823.101 to 823.107 to be done, or not to be so done, or aid or abet any such omission or failure. [Formerly 771.040]

 

      823.107 Existing remedies not affected. Nothing in ORS 823.101 to 823.107 shall deprive any holder of a receipt or bill of lading of any remedy or right of action which the holder has under existing law. [Formerly 771.050]
