FUNDS, ACCOUNTS AND FEES

 

      824.010 Annual fees payable by railroads; audit. (1) Subject to the provisions of subsections (3) and (4) of this section, each railroad shall pay to the Department of Transportation in each year, such fee as the department finds and determines to be necessary, with the amount of all other fees paid or payable to the department by such railroads in the current calendar year, to defray the costs of performing the duties imposed by law upon the department in respect to such railroads and to pay such amounts as may be necessary to obtain matching funds to implement the program referred to in ORS 824.058.

      (2) In each calendar year the percentage rate of the fee required to be paid shall be determined by orders entered by the department on or after March 1 of each year, and notice thereof shall be given to each railroad. Such railroad shall pay to the department the fee or portion thereof so computed upon the date specified in such notice, which date shall be at least 15 days after the date of mailing such notice.

      (3) Fifty percent of the cost of carrying out the duties, functions and powers imposed upon the department by ORS 824.200 to 824.256 shall be paid from the Grade Crossing Protection Account.

      (4) The department shall determine the gross operating revenues derived within this state in the preceding calendar year by Class I railroads as a whole and by other railroads individually subject to the following limitations:

      (a) The total of the fees payable by Class I railroads shall not exceed thirty-five hundredths of one percent of the combined gross operating revenues of Class I railroads derived within this state. The fee paid by each Class I railroad shall bear the same proportion to the total fees paid by Class I railroads as such railroad’s share of railroad-highway crossings, track miles and gross operating revenues derived within the state, weighted equally, bears to the total amount of Class I railroad-highway crossings within the state, track miles within the state and gross operating revenues derived within the state.

      (b) The fees payable by other railroads shall not exceed thirty-five hundredths of one percent of any such railroad’s gross operating revenues.

      (5) Payment of each fee or portion thereof provided for in subsections (1) to (4) of this section shall be accompanied by a statement verified by the railroad involved showing its gross operating revenues upon which such fee or portion thereof is computed. This statement shall be in such form and detail as the Department of Transportation shall prescribe and shall be subject to audit by the department. The department may refund any overpayment of any such fee in the same manner as other claims and expenses of the department are payable as provided by law. [1995 c.733 §§29,30]

 

      824.012 Failure to pay fees; penalty. Every person who fails to pay any fees provided for in ORS 824.010 after they are due and payable shall, in addition to such fees, pay a penalty of two percent of such fees for each and every month or fraction thereof that they remain unpaid. If, in the judgment of the Department of Transportation, action is necessary to collect any unpaid fees or penalties, the department shall bring such action or take such proceedings as may be necessary thereon in the name of the State of Oregon in any court of competent jurisdiction, and be entitled to recover all costs and disbursements incurred therein. [1995 c.733 §31]

State-shared highway fund revenues for cities and counties, as well as Department of Transportation expenditures for the elimination of hazardous railroad-highway crossings, shall be computed and allocated prior to any appropriation or transfer to the account. The amount of $300,000 credited to the account is continuously appropriated and shall be expended for railroad-highway crossing safety as authorized by ORS 824.242 to 824.248 and subsection (2) of this section. The amount credited to the account for paying the cost of carrying out the duties, functions and powers of the department by ORS 824.200 to 824.256 is transferred and appropriated to the Department of Transportation and shall be used as provided in ORS 824.010 (3). No more than $100,000 in the aggregate shall be allocated from the account in any one fiscal year for costs of construction, reconstruction, alteration or relocation of separated crossings; provided however the unapportioned amount in the Grade Crossing Protection Account at the end of each fiscal year may be allocated for costs of reconstruction, alteration or relocation of separated crossings.

      (2) Moneys credited to the account may also be allocated for such highway purposes as the Department of Transportation deems appropriate in order to enhance safety at railroad-highway crossings. The Department of Transportation may allocate no more than $100,000 annually to railroads to defray the costs of maintenance of protective devices at railroad-highway crossings.

      (3) As used in this section, “highway,” “maintenance costs,” “protective device” and “railroad” have the meaning given those terms in ORS 824.200. [Formerly 763.330; 1997 c.249 §245]

[Formerly 763.273]

 

      824.246 Apportionment of costs of crossing closure. If in any grade crossing proceeding arising under ORS 824.204, 824.206 or 824.226, the Department of Transportation requires the closure of any existing crossing within the jurisdiction of the public authority in interest, the department may apportion to the railroad company, for such crossing closed, an amount not to exceed five percent of the cost of installation of protective devices at any new or other existing crossing within the jurisdiction of the public authority in interest. Any additional costs paid by the railroad company shall reduce the share otherwise apportionable to the public authority in interest. [Formerly 763.275]

      (1) Apportion the amount of such federal funds to payment of installation, reconstruction, or alteration costs; and

      (2) Apportion the remaining costs of installation, reconstruction, alteration, and maintenance as provided by ORS 824.238 and 824.242 to 824.248; however, in a case where the federal fund assistance equals or exceeds 75 percent of the cost of installing, altering and reconstructing protective devices at an existing or relocated crossing, the remaining costs, except for maintenance costs, may be allocated entirely to the Grade Crossing Protection Account. [Formerly 763.290]

 

      824.252 Procedure when disagreement as to apportionment exists. (1) In any proceeding under ORS 824.206 or 824.226, where the application to the Department of Transportation states that the parties are not in agreement as to apportionment of costs, but the applicant is willing to advance the amount of money reasonably necessary to enable the respondent to complete the work which must be done by it or the amount reasonably necessary is available and can be advanced from the Grade Crossing Protection Account, the department shall set the application for hearing as soon as the calendar of the department permits on the questions of:

      (a) The necessity for the project;

      (b) The approval of the location and the engineering plans, including provisions for handling traffic during construction and the work to be performed by each party; and

      (c) The sum to be advanced by the applicant or the account for the work to be done by the respondent.

      (2) The Department of Transportation shall render as promptly as possible an interim order, effective within 20 days on such questions, reserving for later hearing and decision the question of the apportionment of costs. The interim order shall also direct the respondent to proceed upon receipt of the sum to be advanced by the applicant or the account without delay to perform the work to be done by respondent, integrating the work with that of the applicant or its contractor in such manner that neither will unreasonably obstruct or delay the work of the other, to the end that the people of the state may have the use of the project at the earliest possible date.

      (3) In the final order apportioning costs, the sum advanced by the applicant or the account shall be credited against its share of the costs. In the final order there shall also be credited against applicant’s share of the costs any increase in the costs found by the Department of Transportation to be directly attributable to respondent’s willful failure or refusal, after the effective date of the interim order, to proceed with its own work or to integrate the work with that of applicant or its contractor. [Formerly 763.300]

 

      824.254 Reimbursement procedure for railroad and public authority.

Upon completion of the construction, reconstruction or alteration of a crossing, or of the installation or alteration of grade crossing warning or safety devices at a crossing, the railroad company or the public authority in interest shall present to the department for approval its claim for reimbursement for the costs thereof in the amount apportioned to the Grade Crossing Protection Account less progress payments previously made. When a claim is approved, the department shall, as funds become available, order the claim paid from the account.

      (2) The department may make such audit as the department considers necessary before or after each such disbursement for the purpose of determining that the money is expended for the purposes and under the conditions authorized by ORS 824.242 to 824.248. By presentation of its claim, the railroad company and the public authority consent to make pertinent records showing costs of labor and materials available to the department.

      (3) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, upon issuance of an order apportioning costs to the Grade Crossing Protection Account, and upon agreement with the Department of Transportation, the railroad company or public authority in interest shall submit an estimate of the costs of the project. The railroad company or public authority in interest may submit statements for lump-sum reimbursement from the account during and at the completion of the construction, reconstruction or alteration of a crossing, or of the installation or alteration of a grade crossing warning or safety device at a crossing.
