      825.160 Liability insurance of carriers. (1) A person may not operate as a motor carrier on public highways of this state until the person has in effect a policy of public liability and property damage insurance.

      (2) Insurance required under this section shall be provided at minimum limits the Department of Transportation by rule may prescribe, and upon such terms, conditions and provisions as the department may determine to be necessary for the reasonable indemnification of the patrons of the applicant and of the public against damage and injury for which the applicant may be liable by reason of the operation of any motor vehicle. However, the insurance policy required of a carrier or persons engaged solely in interstate commerce need not provide for the protection of their patrons.

      (3) In fixing the amount of the insurance policy the Department of Transportation shall give due consideration to the character and amount of traffic, the number of persons involved and the degree of danger which the proposed operation involves. [Formerly 767.195; 2007 c.465 §9]

 

      825.162 Cargo insurance. (1) A certificate or permit may not be issued to any person to operate intrastate as a for-hire carrier of freight or express until the person has in effect cargo insurance in such penal sum as the Department of Transportation may deem necessary to protect adequately the interests of the public. This policy shall bind the assurer for loss of, or damage to, property carried in, upon or attached to the motor vehicles or other equipment operated by, for or under the control of the assured, or while in the care or custody of the assured.

      (2) The department may waive the requirement of cargo insurance for any carrier whose service is limited to commodities not subject to material damage or loss through ordinary transportation hazards. [Formerly 767.200; 2011 c.73 §1]

 

      825.164 Rules for compliance with ORS 825.160 and 825.162; notice prior to cancellation of insurance; suspension of authority when insurance inoperative. (1) The Department of Transportation by rule shall establish a system for determining how motor carriers demonstrate compliance with the insurance requirements of ORS 825.160 and 825.162. The system may require certification of compliance by the carrier or the filing of a policy with the department and may require different acts of compliance based on class of carrier or experience. The system shall also specify what acts constitute failure to comply for purposes of revocation or suspension of the carrier’s authority.

      (2) An insurance policy furnished under ORS 825.160 or 825.162 may not be canceled or otherwise terminated at any time prior to its expiration until the entity that executed the policy has filed with the department a notice of cancellation as provided in the policy. The cancellation is effective not less than 30 days from the date of receipt, and no agreement between the parties thereto shall operate to avoid this restriction upon cancellation.

      (3) If any insurance policy required under ORS 825.160 or 825.162 becomes inoperative, the authority under the certificate or permit involved shall cease and be suspended insofar as it pertains to any affected vehicles until an insurance policy meeting the requirements of ORS 825.160 and 825.162 becomes effective and is accepted by the department. [Formerly 767.205; 2011 c.73 §2]

 

      825.166 Deposit of securities or letter of credit. (1) In lieu of the insurance policy or surety bond, the holder of any certificate or permit may file with the Department of Transportation an irrevocable letter of credit issued by an insured institution, as defined in ORS 706.008, or money, bank or savings and loan savings certificates, or bonds, negotiable by delivery, of the State of Oregon, school districts therein, or of any county therein, or obligations of the United States, or obligations for which the faith of the United States is pledged for the payment of both the principal and interest, equal in amount to the amount of the insurance policy or bond required by the department.

      (2) So long as the deposit remains unencumbered the depositor is entitled to collect the interest upon such securities.

      (3) The department shall hold the securities or letter of credit upon such terms as the department shall designate and approve pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, and shall deliver such securities or letter of credit to the State Treasurer, who shall receive and hold them subject to the lawful orders of the department. The State Treasurer and the surety or letter of credit issuer of the treasurer shall be liable upon the official bond or letter of credit for their safekeeping. The depositors shall reimburse the State Treasurer for any expenses incurred by the treasurer in the mailing, insuring, shipping or delivering of any such securities or letter of credit, or of the interest coupons attached thereto as they mature.

      (4) Such substituted security or letter of credit shall be subject to the liabilities imposed by the terms of the policy of insurance or surety bond or letter of credit then currently used by the department.

      (5) If the securities or letter of credit provided for in this section are furnished in lieu of an insurance policy or bond, they shall not be subject to withdrawal or assignment by the holder of the certificate or permit, either voluntarily or by operation of law, until the expiration of one year after the holder of the certificate or permit, in connection with which they are furnished has:

      (a) Substituted therefor a policy of insurance as provided in ORS 825.160 and 825.162;

      (b) The certificate or permit canceled; or

      (c) Surrendered such certificate or permit to the department for cancellation and has ceased operation thereunder.

      (6) If any such securities become impaired in value, the department shall require additional protection by insurance, bond, letter of credit or substitute security to the extent that the value of the securities may have become impaired. [Formerly 767.210; 1997 c.631 §559; 2011 c.73 §3]

 

      825.168 Self-insurance. (1) Any for-hire carrier, engaged in interstate or interstate and intrastate operations within the State of Oregon, which is or becomes qualified as a self-insurer with the United States Department of Transportation in accordance with laws of the United States applicable to self-insurance by motor carriers, is exempt, so long as such qualification remains effective, from the provisions of ORS 825.160 to 825.166.

      (2) The Department of Transportation may require proof of the existence and continuation of exempt status to be made by affidavit of the carrier in a form and at the times as the department may prescribe. [Formerly 767.215; 2007 c.465 §10]

 

      825.170 Prohibited indemnification provisions in motor carrier transportation contracts; exceptions. (1) Except as provided under subsections (2) and (3) of this section, any provision in a motor carrier transportation contract that requires either party or either party’s surety or insurer to indemnify or hold harmless the other party against liability for death, personal injury or property damage caused in whole or in part by the negligence or intentional acts or omissions of the other party is void.

      (2) This section does not affect any provision in a motor carrier transportation contract that requires either party or either party’s surety or insurer to indemnify another person against liability for death, personal injury or property damage that arises out of the fault of the indemnitor, or the fault of the indemnitor’s agents, representatives or subcontractors.

      (3) This section does not apply to any Uniform Intermodal Interchange and Facilities Access Agreement administered by the Intermodal Association of North America or any other agreement providing for the interchange, use or possession of intermodal chassis, intermodal containers or other intermodal equipment.

      (2) ORS 319.510 to 319.880 do not apply to vehicles or fuels used therein when the vehicles are subject to, and report and pay:

      (a) The tax for the use of Oregon highways based upon the combined weight of the vehicle and in accordance with the weight group rates prescribed in ORS 825.474, 825.476 and 825.480; or

      (b) The road use assessment fee required under ORS 818.225.

      (3) When an audit of the operations of a carrier shows that the use fuel taxes reported and paid under ORS chapter 319 should have been reported and paid under this chapter, or that fees or taxes reported and paid under this chapter should have been reported and paid under ORS chapter 319, the fees or taxes erroneously reported and paid under one chapter need not be refunded but may be considered an offset of fees or taxes due under the other chapter.

      825.486 Credit for fuel tax. Any tax paid under ORS 319.010 to 319.430 or 319.510 to 319.880 on motor vehicle fuel or fuel as defined in ORS 319.520, either directly by the collection of the tax by the vendor from the consumer or indirectly by adding the amount of the tax to the price of the fuel paid by the customer, is a credit against the amount of tax otherwise due and payable to the state under ORS 818.225, 825.474, 825.476 and 825.480.

Annual reports and accompanying remittances shall be filed on or before the due date of February 28 for the preceding calendar year.

      (2) At the request of a motor carrier, the department may authorize the carrier to file quarterly reports in lieu of monthly reports required by ORS 825.490 and 825.515.

      (2) Each assessment shall bear interest at the rate of one percent per month, or fraction thereof, from the last day of the month following the close of the month for which the assessment is imposed until paid.

      (3) There shall be added to every such assessment a penalty of 25 percent of the amount thereof.

      (4) The department shall give to such person written notice of such assessment.

      (5) Whenever the department has made an assessment pursuant to this section that has become final the department may not reopen or reassess such taxes, fees, interest or penalties unless the department is satisfied that the taxpayer fraudulently or with intent to evade taxation destroyed, concealed or withheld any books, accounts, papers, records or memoranda required to be maintained by a person subject to this chapter or the rules of the department.

(1) Any person against whom an assessment is made under ORS 825.490 or 825.494, may petition the Department of Transportation for a reassessment within 30 days after service upon the person of notice. If a petition is not filed within the 30-day period, the assessment becomes final. If a petition for reassessment is filed within the 30-day period the department shall reconsider the assessment and, if the person has requested in the petition, shall grant such person a hearing and give the person 10 days’ notice of the time and place of the hearing. The department has power to continue the hearing from time to time as may be necessary. The decision of the department upon a petition for reassessment shall become final 30 days after service of notice upon the person concerned.

      (2) The department may waive or reduce the interest and penalties provided in ORS 825.490 (1) to (6) or 825.494 (2) or (3) on those terms as the department considers proper if request for waiver or reduction is made within 30 days after service of notice of assessment upon the person concerned, or as part of the pleas made in the department’s reconsideration of the assessment.

All fees, taxes and charges imposed by this chapter and ORS chapter 826, all claims and penalties payable by any person under this chapter and ORS chapter 826 and all moneys collected under this chapter and ORS chapter 826, are the property of the state. The Department of Transportation shall collect and receive all fees, taxes, penalties and moneys due or to become due to the state under this chapter and ORS chapter 826 and, to that end, shall bring such actions or take such proceedings, including attachment and garnishment proceedings, in the name of the State of Oregon, as may be necessary.

(1) Interest and penalties for delinquent payments of road use assessment fees payable pursuant to the provisions of ORS 818.225 and of single-trip nondivisible load permits shall be calculated in the same manner that interest and penalties are calculated under ORS 825.490 and 825.494.

      (2) An audit conducted by the Department of Transportation pursuant to its authority under this chapter may include an examination of records of the carrier pertaining to the road use assessment fee imposed under ORS 818.225. If the audit shows that movement by a carrier exceeds the mileage authorized by a single-trip nondivisible load permit, the department shall determine the amount of the road use assessment fee that is due. The department shall collect the amount due and may impose any penalties or additional assessments authorized by this chapter for delinquent payment of taxes. [Formerly 767.862; 1997 c.275 §28]

      825.504 Warrant procedure for collecting tax, fee, penalty or assessment. (1) If any tax, or fee in lieu of tax, reported due, or any final assessment made by the Department of Transportation under ORS 825.490, 825.494 and 825.496, including any penalties or charges therein imposed, or any final penalty imposed under ORS 825.950, 825.955 or 825.960, is not paid in full, the department may issue a warrant for the amount of the tax, fee or assessment, with the added penalties or charges, interest and the cost of executing the warrant. A copy of the warrant shall be mailed or delivered to the taxpayer by the department at the taxpayer’s last-known address.

      (2) At any time after issuing a warrant under this section, the department may record the warrant in the County Clerk Lien Record of any county of this state. Recording of the warrant has the effect described in ORS 205.125. After recording a warrant, the department may direct the sheriff for the county in which the warrant is recorded to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of the taxpayer found within that county, and to levy upon any currency of the taxpayer found within that county, for the application of the proceeds or currency against the amount reflected in the warrant and the sheriff’s cost of executing the warrant. The sheriff shall proceed on the warrant in the same manner prescribed by law for executions issued against property pursuant to a judgment, and is entitled to the same fees as provided for executions issued against property pursuant to a judgment. The fees of the sheriff shall be added to and collected as a part of the warrant liability.

      (3) In the discretion of the department a warrant under this section may be directed to any agent authorized by the department to collect amounts under this section, and in the execution of the warrant the agent has all of the powers conferred by law upon sheriffs, but is entitled to no fee or compensation in excess of actual expenses paid in the performance of such duty.

      (4) Until a warrant issued under this section is satisfied in full, the department has the same remedies to enforce the claim for the tax, fee or assessment as if the state had recovered judgment against the taxpayer for the amount of the tax, fee or assessment.

      (5) The procedures authorized by this section may also be used for collection of any fees and penalties imposed on persons registering vehicles under ORS chapter 826. [Formerly 767.865; 1997 c.275 §29; 2003 c.576 §222; 2011 c.661 §12]

Moneys deposited under this section shall be deposited with the State Treasurer in an account separate and distinct from the General Fund. Interest earned by the account shall be credited to the account. The deposit required may be increased or reduced by the department at any time. In determining the necessity for an applicant or carrier to maintain a deposit the department shall consider the applicant or carrier’s financial capability and responsibility and the department’s prior experience, if any, in collecting fees, taxes, charges or penalties from the applicant, carrier or any person having a substantial interest or control, directly or indirectly, in or over the operations conducted or to be conducted under the carrier’s authority.

      (2) To secure payment of sums payable by the carrier the department may accept in lieu of such deposit:

      (a) A bond in the form prescribed by the department; or

      (b) Bonds, negotiable by delivery, of the State of Oregon, school districts therein, or obligations of the United States, or obligations for which the faith of the United States is pledged for the payment of both principal and interest, equal in amount to the amount of the requested deposit.

      (3) So long as the deposit remains unencumbered the depositor is entitled to collect the interest upon the securities described in subsection (2)(b) of this section. The department shall hold the securities upon such terms as the department shall designate and approve pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, and shall deliver such securities to the State Treasurer, who shall receive and hold them subject to the lawful orders of the department. The State Treasurer and the surety of the treasurer shall be liable upon the official bond of the treasurer for their safekeeping. The depositors shall reimburse the State Treasurer for any expenses incurred by the treasurer in the mailing, insuring, shipping or delivering of any such securities, or of the interest coupons attached thereto as they mature.

      (4) If a carrier ceases to be a carrier under this chapter, within a reasonable time of the receipt by the department of all payments due, the department shall refund or have returned to the carrier all deposits and securities remaining to the carrier’s credit and shall release the surety on any bond given under this section.

      (5) Any applicant or carrier required under this section to make a deposit to secure the payment of fees, taxes, charges or penalties may by proper petition demand a hearing on the necessity of such deposit or the reasonableness of the amount required. A hearing shall be granted and held within 10 days after the demand therefor. The decision of the department shall become final 10 days after service of the order upon the applicant or carrier concerned. [Formerly 767.870]

 

      825.507 Limitations on cancellation of bond; suspension of authority. (1) No bond filed pursuant to ORS 825.506 may be canceled or otherwise terminated at any time prior to its expiration until the surety company which executed the same, has filed with the Department of Transportation a notice of cancellation as provided in such bond. Such cancellation shall be effective not less than 30 days from the date of receipt, and no agreement between the parties thereto shall operate to avoid this restriction upon cancellation.

      (2) If any bond filed pursuant to ORS 825.506 becomes inoperative, the authority under the certificate or permit involved shall cease and be suspended insofar as it pertains to any affected vehicles until the requirements of ORS 825.506 have been met by the carrier. [Formerly 767.795]

 

      825.508 Use of collection agency to obtain moneys due. (1) In carrying out the duties under ORS 825.498, the Department of Transportation may engage the services of a collection agency to collect any of the fees, taxes, penalties and moneys due to the state under this chapter and ORS chapter 826. The department may engage the services by entering into agreements to pay reasonable charges on a contingent fee or other basis.

      (2) The department may assign to the collection agency, for collection purposes only, any of the fees, taxes, penalties and moneys due the state under this chapter and ORS chapter 826.

      (3) The collection agency may bring such actions or take such proceedings, including attachment and garnishment proceedings, as may be necessary. [Formerly 767.875]

 

      825.509 Writing off uncollected moneys due. (1) Any fee, tax, penalty or money due the state assigned to a collection agency pursuant to ORS 825.508 that remains uncollected for two years after the date of the assignment meets the criteria for uncollectibility formulated pursuant to ORS 293.240.

      (2) ORS 293.245 applies to any fee, tax, penalty or money due the state and described in subsection (1) of this section. [Formerly 767.880; 2011 c.223 §4]

 

      825.515 Daily records and monthly reports by carriers. (1) Every for-hire carrier and private carrier shall keep daily records, upon forms prescribed by the Department of Transportation, of all vehicles used during the current month.

      (2) On or before the last day of the month following, except as otherwise permitted under ORS 825.492, they shall certify to the department, upon forms prescribed therefor, the true and correct summaries of their daily records which shall show the extreme miles traveled in this state during the preceding month, the amount of fuel tax paid to the state during the preceding month, and such other information as the department may require.

      (3) The daily records shall be kept on file in the office of the carrier and thereafter preserved until written permission for their destruction is given by the department. [Formerly 767.905]
