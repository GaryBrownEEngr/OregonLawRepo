See section 68, chapter 750, Oregon Laws 2017, and section 139, chapter 750, Oregon Laws 2017, as amended by section 31, chapter 93, Oregon Laws 2018. The text that is operative on and after January 1, 2024, including amendments by section 29a, chapter 93, Oregon Laws 2018, is set forth for the user’s convenience.

      825.480. (1)(a) In lieu of other fees provided in ORS 825.474, carriers engaged in operating motor vehicles in the transportation of logs, poles, peeler cores or piling may pay annual fees for such operation computed at the rate of $11.60 for each 100 pounds of declared combined weight.

      (b) Any carrier electing to pay fees under this method may, as to vehicles otherwise exempt from taxation, elect to be taxed on the mileage basis for movements of such empty vehicles over public highways whenever operations are for the purpose of repair, maintenance, servicing or moving from one exempt highway operation to another.

      (2) The annual fees provided in subsections (1), (4) and (5) of this section may be paid on a monthly basis. Any carrier electing to pay fees under this method may not change an election during the same calendar year in which the election is made, but may be relieved from the payment due for any month during which a motor vehicle is not operated. A carrier electing to pay fees under this method shall report and pay these fees on or before the 10th of each month for the preceding month’s operations. A monthly report shall be made on all vehicles on the annual fee basis including any vehicle not operated for the month.

      (3)(a) In lieu of the fees provided in ORS 825.470 to 825.474, motor vehicles described in ORS 825.024 with a combined weight of less than 46,000 pounds that are being operated under a permit issued under ORS 825.102 may pay annual fees for such operation computed at the rate of $9.60 for each 100 pounds of declared combined weight.

      (b) The annual fees provided in this subsection shall be paid in advance but may be paid on a monthly basis on or before the first day of the month. A carrier may be relieved from the fees due for any month during which the motor vehicle is not operated for hire if a statement to that effect is filed with the Department of Transportation on or before the fifth day of the first month for which relief is sought.

      (4)(a) In lieu of other fees provided in ORS 825.474, carriers engaged in the operation of motor vehicles equipped with dump bodies and used in the transportation of sand, gravel, rock, dirt, debris, cinders, asphaltic concrete mix, metallic ores and concentrates or raw nonmetallic products, whether crushed or otherwise, moving from mines, pits or quarries may pay annual fees for such operation computed at the rate of $11.50 for each 100 pounds of declared combined weight.

      (b) Any carrier electing to pay fees under this method may, as to vehicles otherwise exempt for taxation, elect to be taxed on the mileage basis for movements of such empty vehicles over public highways whenever operations are for the purpose of repair, maintenance, servicing or moving from one exempt highway operation to another.

      (5)(a) In lieu of other fees provided in ORS 825.474, carriers engaged in operating motor vehicles in the transportation of wood chips, sawdust, barkdust, hog fuel or shavings may pay annual fees for such operation computed at the rate of $47 for each 100 pounds of declared combined weight.

      (b) Any carrier electing to pay under this method may, as to vehicles otherwise exempt from taxation, elect to be taxed on the mileage basis for movement of such empty vehicles over public highways whenever operations are for the purpose of repair, maintenance, service or moving from one exempt highway operation to another.

 

      825.482 Review of flat fee rates. The Department of Transportation and the Oregon Transportation Commission shall review flat fee rates established under ORS 825.480 in each even-numbered year and shall recommend to the next following odd-numbered year regular session of the Legislative Assembly any adjustments to the flat fee rates that the department and the commission deem appropriate. [1989 c.992 §28; 2011 c.545 §67]

 

      Note: 825.482 was enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter 825 or any series therein by legislative action. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.

 

      825.484 Effect of carrier tax law on other taxes; offset of fees or taxes erroneously paid. (1) The fees or taxes listed in ORS 825.474, 825.476 and 825.480 shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, other fees and taxes of the state, county or municipality which may be imposed, levied, assessed or collected against the business or property of such carrier. This section does not authorize the imposition of license fees by municipalities upon intercity carriers, or deprive any city within which a passenger motor vehicle, having a seating capacity of not more than seven passengers, is principally operated for hire, from imposing and collecting license fees upon and from such motor vehicle, or the owner or operator thereof, as to such portion of its operations as are wholly within the corporate limits of such city.

      (2) ORS 319.510 to 319.880 do not apply to vehicles or fuels used therein when the vehicles are subject to, and report and pay:

      (a) The tax for the use of Oregon highways based upon the combined weight of the vehicle and in accordance with the weight group rates prescribed in ORS 825.474, 825.476 and 825.480; or

      (b) The road use assessment fee required under ORS 818.225.

      (3) When an audit of the operations of a carrier shows that the use fuel taxes reported and paid under ORS chapter 319 should have been reported and paid under this chapter, or that fees or taxes reported and paid under this chapter should have been reported and paid under ORS chapter 319, the fees or taxes erroneously reported and paid under one chapter need not be refunded but may be considered an offset of fees or taxes due under the other chapter. [Formerly 767.830; 2015 c.77 §3]

 

      825.486 Credit for fuel tax. Any tax paid under ORS 319.010 to 319.430 or 319.510 to 319.880 on motor vehicle fuel or fuel as defined in ORS 319.520, either directly by the collection of the tax by the vendor from the consumer or indirectly by adding the amount of the tax to the price of the fuel paid by the customer, is a credit against the amount of tax otherwise due and payable to the state under ORS 818.225, 825.474, 825.476 and 825.480. A credit under this section shall be allowed when the person claiming the credit submits to the Department of Transportation:

      (1) A report under ORS 825.480, 825.490 or 825.492; and

      (2) Satisfactory evidence along with the report showing the amount of tax paid by the person under ORS 319.010 to 319.430 or 319.510 to 319.880 during the period reported. [Formerly 767.832; 2015 c.77 §4]

 

      825.488 Fees required of interstate carriers. A person engaged exclusively in the conduct of interstate transportation shall currently pay to the Department of Transportation the road tax mileage fees prescribed by ORS 825.474, 825.476, 825.480, 825.484, 825.490, 825.494 and 825.496. [Formerly 767.835]

 

      825.490 Due date of taxes and fees; penalty; deficiency assessments; refund of overpayment; limitation on audit. (1) On or before the last day of each month, except for the time of payment provided in ORS 825.480 and 825.492, all persons shall report and pay to the Department of Transportation the amount of taxes and fees due from them for the preceding calendar month. However, taxes and fees incurred after the 15th day of any month may be reported and paid to the department on or before the last day of the second calendar month following the month in which the taxes or fees were incurred. If no taxes or fees are due in any reporting period, the report shall so state. If payment is not made on or before the date it is due, there shall be added as a late payment charge a sum equal to 10 percent of the unpaid amount of the tax.

      (2) The department may permit a person to report and pay motor carrier taxes and fees on a periodic basis other than the calendar-month basis prescribed in subsection (1) of this section, provided that the number of reporting periods in any 12-month period is not less than 12. If no taxes or fees are due in any reporting period, the report shall so state. If payment is not made on or before the date it is due, there shall be added as a late payment charge a sum equal to 10 percent of the unpaid amount of the tax.

      (3) Whenever practicable, and in no event later than three years after any report of taxes or fees is filed, the department shall audit the report if the department deems such audit practicable. If the department is not satisfied with the report filed or amount of taxes or fees, including fees for temporary passes required under ORS 825.470, paid to the state by any person, the department may, not later than three years after the report was filed or the taxes or fees were paid, make a proposed assessment of additional taxes or fees due from such person based upon any information available to the department. There shall be added to each such assessment, as a late payment charge, a sum equal to 10 percent of the amount of additional taxes or fees due.

      (4) Every such additional assessment shall bear interest at the rate of one percent per month, or fraction thereof, from the last day of the month following the close of the month for which the additional assessment is imposed until paid.

      (5) If the additional assessment imposed exceeds by at least five percent but not more than 15 percent the amount of taxes or fees reported or paid, a penalty of five percent of the amount of the additional assessment shall be added thereto in addition to the 10 percent late payment charge provided in subsection (3) of this section.

      (6) If the additional assessment imposed exceeds by more than 15 percent the amount of taxes or fees reported or paid, a penalty of 20 percent of the amount of the additional assessment shall be added thereto in addition to the 10 percent late payment charge provided in subsection (3) of this section.

      (7) The department shall give to the person concerned written notice of such additional assessment.

      (8) Except as provided in ORS 825.484 (3), the department shall refund to any person the amount of any overpayment caused by any incorrect report.

      (9) Whenever the department has made an assessment pursuant to this section that has become final the department may not reopen or reassess such taxes, interest or penalties unless the department is satisfied that the taxpayer fraudulently or with intent to evade taxation destroyed, concealed or withheld any books, accounts, papers, records or memoranda required to be maintained by the taxpayer pursuant to this chapter or the rules of the department. [Formerly 767.840; 2007 c.71 §246]

 

      825.492 Annual and quarterly reports authorized. (1) Whenever in the judgment of the Department of Transportation the estimated annual tax payable by a carrier will be less than $100, and the vehicles operated by the carrier are of less than 30,000 pounds combined weight, the department may authorize the carrier to file reports annually in lieu of monthly reports required by ORS 825.490 and 825.515. Annual reports and accompanying remittances shall be filed on or before the due date of February 28 for the preceding calendar year.

      (2) At the request of a motor carrier, the department may authorize the carrier to file quarterly reports in lieu of monthly reports required by ORS 825.490 and 825.515. Quarterly reports and accompanying remittances due shall be filed on or before the due date as follows: First calendar quarter, May 31; second quarter, August 31; third quarter, November 30; fourth quarter, February 28.

      (3) Such authorizations may be withdrawn at any time upon the mailing of notice to the carrier at the last address of record of the carrier with the department. Any provisions of ORS 825.490 and 825.515 otherwise applicable to reports and remittances shall be applicable to reports and remittances under this section. [Formerly 767.845; 2001 c.567 §11]

 

      825.494 Assessment by department upon failure to report tax or fee due. (1) If any person neglects or refuses to make a fee or tax report as required by this chapter, the Department of Transportation shall make a proposed assessment, based upon any information available to the department, for the period for which such person failed to make a report, of the amount of taxes and fees, including fees for temporary passes required under ORS 825.470, due for the period for which such proposed assessment is made.

      (2) Each assessment shall bear interest at the rate of one percent per month, or fraction thereof, from the last day of the month following the close of the month for which the assessment is imposed until paid.

      (3) There shall be added to every such assessment a penalty of 25 percent of the amount thereof.

      (4) The department shall give to such person written notice of such assessment.

      (5) Whenever the department has made an assessment pursuant to this section that has become final the department may not reopen or reassess such taxes, fees, interest or penalties unless the department is satisfied that the taxpayer fraudulently or with intent to evade taxation destroyed, concealed or withheld any books, accounts, papers, records or memoranda required to be maintained by a person subject to this chapter or the rules of the department. [Formerly 767.850; 2007 c.71 §247]

 

      825.496 Reassessment waiver or reduction upon request; charge for failure to appear at hearing. (1) Any person against whom an assessment is made under ORS 825.490 or 825.494, may petition the Department of Transportation for a reassessment within 30 days after service upon the person of notice. If a petition is not filed within the 30-day period, the assessment becomes final. If a petition for reassessment is filed within the 30-day period the department shall reconsider the assessment and, if the person has requested in the petition, shall grant such person a hearing and give the person 10 days’ notice of the time and place of the hearing. The department has power to continue the hearing from time to time as may be necessary. The decision of the department upon a petition for reassessment shall become final 30 days after service of notice upon the person concerned.

      (2) The department may waive or reduce the interest and penalties provided in ORS 825.490 (1) to (6) or 825.494 (2) or (3) on those terms as the department considers proper if request for waiver or reduction is made within 30 days after service of notice of assessment upon the person concerned, or as part of the pleas made in the department’s reconsideration of the assessment.

      (3) Every assessment made by the department under ORS 825.490 to 825.496 becomes due and payable at the time it becomes final and if not paid to the department when due and payable there shall be added to the assessment a penalty of 10 percent of the amount of the tax.

      (4) If any person who has requested a hearing pursuant to this section fails to appear at the scheduled hearing and failed to withdraw the petition for reassessment at least five days before the date of the hearing, the department may require such person to pay a charge of $150 in addition to any other fees, taxes and charges which may be imposed under this chapter. [Formerly 767.855]

 

      825.498 Collection of fees, taxes and other moneys. All fees, taxes and charges imposed by this chapter and ORS chapter 826, all claims and penalties payable by any person under this chapter and ORS chapter 826 and all moneys collected under this chapter and ORS chapter 826, are the property of the state. The Department of Transportation shall collect and receive all fees, taxes, penalties and moneys due or to become due to the state under this chapter and ORS chapter 826 and, to that end, shall bring such actions or take such proceedings, including attachment and garnishment proceedings, in the name of the State of Oregon, as may be necessary. [Formerly 767.860]

 

      825.500 Calculation of interest and penalties for delinquent road use assessment fees and single-use nondivisible load permits; audit. (1) Interest and penalties for delinquent payments of road use assessment fees payable pursuant to the provisions of ORS 818.225 and of single-trip nondivisible load permits shall be calculated in the same manner that interest and penalties are calculated under ORS 825.490 and 825.494.

      (2) An audit conducted by the Department of Transportation pursuant to its authority under this chapter may include an examination of records of the carrier pertaining to the road use assessment fee imposed under ORS 818.225. If the audit shows that movement by a carrier exceeds the mileage authorized by a single-trip nondivisible load permit, the department shall determine the amount of the road use assessment fee that is due. The department shall collect the amount due and may impose any penalties or additional assessments authorized by this chapter for delinquent payment of taxes. [Formerly 767.862; 1997 c.275 §28]

 

      825.502 Payment of taxes and fees by credit card; rules. For payment of any weight-mile taxes and fees, the Department of Transportation may:

      (1) Accept payment of taxes and fees by credit card. Any payment made by credit card shall be for the full amount of the tax or fee, except that a surcharge may be added to the amount tendered by the customer to offset fees charged to the department for acceptance and use of the credit card.

      (2) Adopt reasonable rules as necessary or proper for the administration of this section. [Formerly 767.863]

 

      825.504 Warrant procedure for collecting tax, fee, penalty or assessment. (1) If any tax, or fee in lieu of tax, reported due, or any final assessment made by the Department of Transportation under ORS 825.490, 825.494 and 825.496, including any penalties or charges therein imposed, or any final penalty imposed under ORS 825.950, 825.955 or 825.960, is not paid in full, the department may issue a warrant for the amount of the tax, fee or assessment, with the added penalties or charges, interest and the cost of executing the warrant. A copy of the warrant shall be mailed or delivered to the taxpayer by the department at the taxpayer’s last-known address.

      (2) At any time after issuing a warrant under this section, the department may record the warrant in the County Clerk Lien Record of any county of this state. Recording of the warrant has the effect described in ORS 205.125. After recording a warrant, the department may direct the sheriff for the county in which the warrant is recorded to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of the taxpayer found within that county, and to levy upon any currency of the taxpayer found within that county, for the application of the proceeds or currency against the amount reflected in the warrant and the sheriff’s cost of executing the warrant. The sheriff shall proceed on the warrant in the same manner prescribed by law for executions issued against property pursuant to a judgment, and is entitled to the same fees as provided for executions issued against property pursuant to a judgment. The fees of the sheriff shall be added to and collected as a part of the warrant liability.

      (3) In the discretion of the department a warrant under this section may be directed to any agent authorized by the department to collect amounts under this section, and in the execution of the warrant the agent has all of the powers conferred by law upon sheriffs, but is entitled to no fee or compensation in excess of actual expenses paid in the performance of such duty.

      (4) Until a warrant issued under this section is satisfied in full, the department has the same remedies to enforce the claim for the tax, fee or assessment as if the state had recovered judgment against the taxpayer for the amount of the tax, fee or assessment.

      (5) The procedures authorized by this section may also be used for collection of any fees and penalties imposed on persons registering vehicles under ORS chapter 826. [Formerly 767.865; 1997 c.275 §29; 2003 c.576 §222; 2011 c.661 §12]

 

      825.506 Deposit or bond to secure payment of fees, taxes, charges and penalties. (1) If the Department of Transportation finds it necessary in order to insure the collection of any fees, taxes, charges or penalties imposed upon a carrier pursuant to this chapter or ORS 818.225, the department may at the time and as a condition of granting a certificate or permit, or continuing the same, or as a condition of issuing a motor vehicle registration device, require a carrier to deposit and keep on deposit with the department a sum in an amount determined proper by the department, taking into account the nature and scope of the carrier’s operations. Moneys deposited under this section shall be deposited with the State Treasurer in an account separate and distinct from the General Fund. Interest earned by the account shall be credited to the account. The deposit required may be increased or reduced by the department at any time. In determining the necessity for an applicant or carrier to maintain a deposit the department shall consider the applicant or carrier’s financial capability and responsibility and the department’s prior experience, if any, in collecting fees, taxes, charges or penalties from the applicant, carrier or any person having a substantial interest or control, directly or indirectly, in or over the operations conducted or to be conducted under the carrier’s authority.

      (2) To secure payment of sums payable by the carrier the department may accept in lieu of such deposit:

      (a) A bond in the form prescribed by the department; or

      (b) Bonds, negotiable by delivery, of the State of Oregon, school districts therein, or obligations of the United States, or obligations for which the faith of the United States is pledged for the payment of both principal and interest, equal in amount to the amount of the requested deposit.

      (3) So long as the deposit remains unencumbered the depositor is entitled to collect the interest upon the securities described in subsection (2)(b) of this section. The department shall hold the securities upon such terms as the department shall designate and approve pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, and shall deliver such securities to the State Treasurer, who shall receive and hold them subject to the lawful orders of the department. The State Treasurer and the surety of the treasurer shall be liable upon the official bond of the treasurer for their safekeeping. The depositors shall reimburse the State Treasurer for any expenses incurred by the treasurer in the mailing, insuring, shipping or delivering of any such securities, or of the interest coupons attached thereto as they mature.

      (4) If a carrier ceases to be a carrier under this chapter, within a reasonable time of the receipt by the department of all payments due, the department shall refund or have returned to the carrier all deposits and securities remaining to the carrier’s credit and shall release the surety on any bond given under this section.

      (5) Any applicant or carrier required under this section to make a deposit to secure the payment of fees, taxes, charges or penalties may by proper petition demand a hearing on the necessity of such deposit or the reasonableness of the amount required. A hearing shall be granted and held within 10 days after the demand therefor. The decision of the department shall become final 10 days after service of the order upon the applicant or carrier concerned. [Formerly 767.870]

 

      825.507 Limitations on cancellation of bond; suspension of authority. (1) No bond filed pursuant to ORS 825.506 may be canceled or otherwise terminated at any time prior to its expiration until the surety company which executed the same, has filed with the Department of Transportation a notice of cancellation as provided in such bond. Such cancellation shall be effective not less than 30 days from the date of receipt, and no agreement between the parties thereto shall operate to avoid this restriction upon cancellation.

      (2) If any bond filed pursuant to ORS 825.506 becomes inoperative, the authority under the certificate or permit involved shall cease and be suspended insofar as it pertains to any affected vehicles until the requirements of ORS 825.506 have been met by the carrier. [Formerly 767.795]

 

      825.508 Use of collection agency to obtain moneys due. (1) In carrying out the duties under ORS 825.498, the Department of Transportation may engage the services of a collection agency to collect any of the fees, taxes, penalties and moneys due to the state under this chapter and ORS chapter 826. The department may engage the services by entering into agreements to pay reasonable charges on a contingent fee or other basis.

      (2) The department may assign to the collection agency, for collection purposes only, any of the fees, taxes, penalties and moneys due the state under this chapter and ORS chapter 826.

      (3) The collection agency may bring such actions or take such proceedings, including attachment and garnishment proceedings, as may be necessary. [Formerly 767.875]

 

      825.509 Writing off uncollected moneys due. (1) Any fee, tax, penalty or money due the state assigned to a collection agency pursuant to ORS 825.508 that remains uncollected for two years after the date of the assignment meets the criteria for uncollectibility formulated pursuant to ORS 293.240.

      (2) ORS 293.245 applies to any fee, tax, penalty or money due the state and described in subsection (1) of this section. [Formerly 767.880; 2011 c.223 §4]

 

      825.515 Daily records and monthly reports by carriers. (1) Every for-hire carrier and private carrier shall keep daily records, upon forms prescribed by the Department of Transportation, of all vehicles used during the current month.

      (2) On or before the last day of the month following, except as otherwise permitted under ORS 825.492, they shall certify to the department, upon forms prescribed therefor, the true and correct summaries of their daily records which shall show the extreme miles traveled in this state during the preceding month, the amount of fuel tax paid to the state during the preceding month, and such other information as the department may require.

      (3) The daily records shall be kept on file in the office of the carrier and thereafter preserved until written permission for their destruction is given by the department. [Formerly 767.905]

 

      825.517 Certain records not public. (1) The following are not public records unless the public interest requires disclosure in the particular instance:

      (a) Reports from motor carriers required to be filed with the Department of Transportation in connection with the imposition or collection of any tax.

      (b) Information collected by the department from a motor carrier for the purpose of conducting a tax audit.

      (2) A motor carrier to whom the information pertains, or a person who has written permission from the carrier, may inspect information described in subsection (1) of this section.

      (3) The department, upon request or as required by law, shall disclose information from the records described in subsection (1) of this section to a government agency for use in carrying out its governmental functions. [1997 c.501 §2]
