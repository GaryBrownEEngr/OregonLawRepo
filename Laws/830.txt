Tests shall be administered upon the request of a peace officer having reasonable grounds to believe that the person arrested was operating a boat while under the influence of intoxicants while in violation of ORS 830.325 or of a municipal ordinance. Before the test is administered, the person requested to take the test shall be informed of rights and consequences as described in ORS 830.545.

      (2) No chemical test of the person’s breath shall be given under subsection (1) of this section, to a person under arrest for operating a boat while under the influence of intoxicants in violation of ORS 830.325 or of a municipal ordinance, if the person refuses the request of a peace officer to submit to the chemical test after the person has been informed of rights and consequences as described in ORS 830.545.

      830.510 Chemical evidence of use of intoxicants. (1) At the trial of any civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding arising out of the acts committed by a person operating a boat while under the influence of any intoxicants, if the amount of alcohol in the person’s blood at the time alleged is less than 0.08 percent by weight of alcohol and shown by chemical analysis of the person’s breath or blood, it is indirect evidence that may be used with other evidence, if any, to determine whether or not the person was then under the influence of intoxicants.

      (2) Not less than 0.08 percent by weight of alcohol in a person’s blood constitutes being under the influence of intoxicating liquor.

      (3) Percent by weight of alcohol in the blood shall be based on grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood or based on grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.

      (4) For purposes of ORS 830.505 to 830.545, “boat” means a motorboat or sailboat. [1991 c.931 §6; 2011 c.260 §2]

      830.520 Circumstances under which chemical tests may be administered. Nothing in ORS 830.505 is intended to preclude the administration of chemical tests described in this section. A peace officer may obtain a chemical test of the blood to determine the amount of alcohol in any person’s blood or a test of the person’s blood or a test of the person’s blood or urine, or both, to determine the presence of cannabis or a controlled substance in the person as provided in the following:

      (1) If, when requested by a peace officer, the person expressly consents to such a test.

      (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, from a person without the person’s consent if:

      (a) The peace officer has probable cause to believe that the person was operating a boat while under the influence of an intoxicating liquor, cannabis or a controlled substance and that evidence of the offense will be found in the person’s blood or urine; and

      (b) The person is unconscious or otherwise in a condition rendering the person incapable of expressly consenting to the test or tests requested. [1991 c.931 §9; 2017 c.21 §94]

 

      830.525 Chemical tests obtained by subject. In addition to chemical tests of the breath, blood or urine administered under ORS 830.505 and 830.520, upon the request of a peace officer, a person shall be permitted upon request, at the person’s own expense, reasonable opportunity to have any licensed physician, licensed professional nurse or qualified technician, chemist or other qualified person of the person’s own choosing administer a chemical test or tests of the person’s breath or blood for the purpose of determining the alcoholic content of the person’s blood or a chemical test or tests of the person’s blood or urine, or both, for the purpose of determining the presence of cannabis or a controlled substance in the person. The failure or inability to obtain such a test or tests by a person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to a test or tests taken upon the request of a peace officer. [1991 c.931 §10; 2017 c.21 §95]

 

      830.535 Criteria for chemical analyses. (1) A chemical analysis is valid under ORS 830.505, 830.520 or 830.525 if:

For purposes of this section, the board shall do all of the following:

      (A) Approve methods of performing chemical analyses of a person’s breath.

      (B) Prepare manuals and conduct courses throughout the state for the training of peace officers in chemical analyses of a person’s breath, which courses shall include, but are not limited to, approved methods of chemical analyses, use of approved equipment and interpretation of test results together with a written examination on these subjects.

      (C) Test and certify the accuracy of equipment to be used by peace officers for chemical analyses of a person’s breath before regular use of the equipment and periodically thereafter at intervals of not more than 90 days.

      (2) An abandoned vessel or a derelict vessel is considered to have been seized for the purposes of ORS 830.908 to 830.948 at the time the enforcement agency takes physical control of the vessel under subsection (1)(a) of this section, posts a notice on the vessel under subsection (1)(b) of this section or marks the vessel under subsection (1)(c) of this section. [2013 c.680 §5a]

 

      830.930 [Formerly 488.675; repealed by 1999 c.692 §13]

 

      830.931 Post-seizure notice. (1) Not more than seven days after an enforcement agency seizes a vessel under ORS 830.908 to 830.948, the enforcement agency shall post notice in the form required by this section on any website maintained by the enforcement agency and mail a copy of the notice to the persons described in ORS 830.918 (1).

      (2) The notice required under this section must include the date by which the costs of salvage, towing and storage must be paid to avoid title to the vessel vesting in the enforcement agency. The date may not be less than 30 days after the date on which the vessel was seized.

      (3) The notice required under this section must include a description of the vessel and of any personal property located on the vessel, and state all of the following:

      (a) That the vessel has been seized.

      (b) The time of the seizure.

      (c) The name, address and telephone number of the enforcement agency.

      (d) The reason the vessel was seized.

      (f) That title to the vessel will vest in the enforcement agency if the costs of salvage, towing and storage are not paid, and the date by which those costs must be paid.

      (g) That the owner may request a hearing, and the time and manner for requesting a hearing.

      (h) That the owner may challenge the reasonableness of any salvage, towing or storage costs at the hearing.

      (i) That the vessel and its contents may be immediately reclaimed by presenting proof of ownership or right to possession and payment of the costs that have accrued.

      (4) Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, an owner of a vessel may request a hearing after an enforcement agency seizes a vessel under ORS 830.908 to 830.948 by submitting a written request for hearing to the enforcement agency not more than 10 business days after the notice required by this section is given. The request must include a statement of the specific grounds on which the seizure is challenged, and whether the owner challenges the reasonableness of any salvage, towing or storage costs incurred by the enforcement agency.

      (5) If an owner of a vessel requested a hearing under ORS 830.918 (5), the owner may request a hearing under subsection (4) of this section only for the purpose of challenging the reasonableness of any salvage, towing or storage costs incurred by the enforcement agency. [2013 c.680 §6]

 

      830.933 Reclamation of seized vessel. (1) At any time before the date specified in the notice given pursuant to ORS 830.931 (2), any owner may reclaim the vessel by:

      (a) Paying all costs incurred by the enforcement agency in salvaging, towing and storing the vessel; and

      (b) Establishing to the satisfaction of the enforcement agency that the owner is able to move the vessel to a place where the vessel can be lawfully kept.

      (2) If a vessel seized under ORS 830.908 to 830.948 is not reclaimed in the manner provided by this section, title to the vessel and all personal property found in the vessel vests in the enforcement agency, and the enforcement agency may sell or otherwise dispose of the vessel and the property. [2013 c.680 §9]

 

      830.935 [Formerly 488.680; repealed by 1999 c.692 §13]

 

      830.936 Hearing. (1) If an owner of a vessel requests a preseizure hearing as provided in ORS 830.918 (5), the enforcement agency may not seize the vessel until after the hearing.

      (2) If an owner of a vessel requests a hearing as provided in ORS 830.918 (5) or 830.931 (4), the enforcement agency shall set a time for the hearing that is no more than seven business days after the enforcement agency receives the request. The enforcement agency shall provide notice of the hearing to the person requesting the hearing, and to all other persons described in ORS 830.918 (1).

      (3) If an owner of a vessel requests a hearing under this section and fails to appear at the hearing, the owner is not entitled to another hearing unless the owner shows good reasons to the enforcement agency for the person’s failure to appear.

      (4) An enforcement agency shall conduct a single hearing under this section for all requests for hearing that relate to the same vessel.

      (5) Hearings held under this section may be informal in nature, but the presentation of evidence in a hearing shall be consistent with the standards for presentation of evidence under ORS 183.450.

      (6) If the notice given under ORS 830.918 indicates that the enforcement agency proposes to seize a vessel by reason of being an abandoned vessel, and the owner of a vessel requests a preseizure hearing under ORS 830.918 (5), the owner may present a plan of action for moving the vessel to a place where the vessel can be lawfully kept. If the notice given under ORS 830.918 indicates that the enforcement agency proposes to seize a vessel by reason of being a derelict vessel, and the owner of a vessel requests a preseizure hearing under ORS 830.918 (5), the owner may present a plan of action for remedying the problems identified in the notice. If the hearing officer approves the plan of action, the hearing officer by order may establish a time for moving the vessel, or remedying the problems, that is later than the time specified in the notice. If the hearing officer issues an order under this subsection, and the owner fails to move the vessel, or to remedy the problems, within the time allowed, the enforcement agency may seize the vessel and take such other action authorized under ORS 830.908 to 830.948 without further notice to the owner or opportunity for hearing except:

      (a) Giving post-seizure notice under ORS 830.931; and

      (b) If the owner requests a hearing under ORS 830.918 (5), allowing the owner to challenge the reasonableness of salvage, towing or storage costs as provided under ORS 830.931 (5).

      (7) If the owner of a vessel requests a post-seizure hearing under ORS 830.931 (4) to challenge the reasonableness of costs incurred by the enforcement agency in salvaging, towing or storage of the vessel, costs that were incurred in compliance with laws, ordinances or rules establishing allowable costs for those purposes are reasonable as a matter of law.

      (8) If an enforcement agency determines after a hearing under this section that seizure of the vessel is not warranted under the law, the enforcement agency shall immediately release custody of the vessel to the owner who requested the hearing and may not charge the owner any costs incurred by the agency in salvaging, towing or storage of the vessel.

      (9) If an enforcement agency determines after a hearing under this section that seizure of the vessel is warranted, the enforcement agency shall seize the vessel if the vessel has not already been seized and dispose of the vessel as provided in ORS 830.933.

      (10) An enforcement agency shall mail a written statement of the enforcement agency’s determination to all owners who requested a hearing under this section.

      (11) The hearing officer at a hearing under this section may be an officer, official or employee of the enforcement agency but may not have participated in any determination or investigation related to seizure of the vessel that is the subject of the hearing.

      (12) If the enforcement agency conducting a hearing under this section is a state agency, the determination of the enforcement agency is an order other than a contested case and is subject to review under ORS 183.484. If the enforcement agency conducting a hearing under this section is not a state agency, judicial review of the order is as provided in ORS 34.010 to 34.100. [2013 c.680 §7]

 

      830.938 Liability for costs of salvage, towing and storage. (1) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 830.908 to 830.948, the owner of an abandoned vessel or a derelict vessel is liable to an enforcement agency for all costs arising out of salvage, towing, storage and disposal of a vessel seized under ORS 830.908 to 830.948. Any order imposing liability for those costs is subject to judicial review as provided in ORS 830.936 (12).

      (2) If an enforcement agency sells a vessel seized under ORS 830.908 to 830.948, the liability imposed under this section shall be reduced by the net proceeds of the sale.

      (3) Except for costs of reclaiming a vessel under ORS 830.933 (1), an owner of a vessel whose only interest in the vessel is a security interest is not liable for costs arising out of salvage, towing, storage and disposal of a vessel under ORS 830.908 to 830.948. [2013 c.680 §8]

 

      830.940 Use of contractor. An enforcement agency may enter into a contract with any person to carry out the provisions of ORS 830.908 to 830.948 on behalf of the enforcement agency. [2013 c.680 §11]

 

      830.944 Offenses. (1) A person commits the offense of failure to remove an abandoned vessel if the person is the owner of an abandoned vessel and, after notice is given under ORS 830.918, the person fails to move the vessel to a place where the vessel can be lawfully kept within the time specified in the notice, or within the time allowed under an order issued under ORS 830.936 (6).

      (2) A person commits the offense of possession of a derelict vessel if the person is the owner of a derelict vessel and, after notice is given under ORS 830.918, the person fails to remedy the problems identified in the notice within the time specified in the notice, or within the time allowed under an order issued under ORS 830.936 (6).

      (3) An owner of a vessel does not violate this section if the owner’s only interest in the vessel is a security interest. [2013 c.680 §12]

 

      830.948 Salvaged Vessel Subaccount; sources; limits; uses.
